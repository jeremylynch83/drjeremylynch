<h1>Endovascular treatment of aneurysms</h1>
<p class="lead text-secondary">
Minimally invasive procedures including coiling, stent-assisted coiling,
flow diversion, and intrasaccular devices.
</p>
<p>The development of endovascular techniques has completely
revolutionised the treatment of brain aneurysms increasing the safety of
the procedure and reducing the invasiveness and recovery time. The
majority of brain aneurysms are now treated using endovascular
techniques. There are very few aneurysms that cannot now be treated
endovascularly.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-endovascular-treatment-involve">What does endovascular
treatment involve?</h2>
<p>Rather than requiring a large incision and direct surgical access to
the aneurysm, endovascular treatment achieves its goal by guiding small,
specialized devices through the patient’s blood vessels (the body’s own
natural highways) to the site of the aneurysm. Embolisation means to
promote clot formation within the aneurysm, commonly by inserting
devices such as coils into the aneurysm or placing stents acoss its
neck.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?</h2>
<p>All endovascular treatments aim to initiate the body’s natural
healing process and involve first filling the aneurysm with a stable
clot. This seals off the aneurysm, preventing blood from entering it.
The wall of the blood vessel remodels over time, completing the healing
and eliminating the aneurysm.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-the-types-of-endovascular-treatment">What are the types
of endovascular treatment?</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Coiling (Endovascular Coiling or Coil Embolization). This involves
small, soft platinum coils being threaded through a catheter and placed
directly into the aneurysm.</li>
<li>Stent-Assisted Coiling. Stents are small, tube-shaped devices that
are used in conjunction with coils to provide support to the weakened
arterial wall. They also help keep the coils within the aneurysm sac.
The stent remains in the artery permanently.</li>
<li>Flow Diversion. This treatment employs a device called a flow
diverter, similar to a stent but with denser walls. It’s placed in the
artery carrying blood to the aneurysm. Instead of filling the aneurysm
with coils, the flow diverter redirects blood flow away from the
aneurysm. This reduced blood flow into the aneurysm promotes clotting
within the aneurysm, leading to its closure. Coils are not mandatory but
are sometimes also placed.</li>
<li>Intrasaccular devices such as the Woven Endobridge (WEB). These are
placed directly into the aneurysm sac via a catheter, similar to
coiling, but are able to treat aneurysms that would otherwise require
stents.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="how-is-coil-embolisation-performed">How is coil embolisation
performed?</h2>
<p>Coil embolisation is undertaken during general anaesthesia. The
doctor makes a small incision of about 3 mm, typically in the wrist or
groin, to access a blood vessel. Following this, they insert a long,
thin tube, called a catheter, through the incision into the blood
vessel. Using a method called fluoroscopy, which involves real-time
X-ray imaging, the doctor is able to navigate the catheter through the
patient’s vascular system until it reaches the blood vessels of the
brain where the aneurysm is located.</p>
<p>Once the catheter is in position, small platinum coils are threaded
through the catheter and into the aneurysm. These coils are soft and
flexible, allowing them to adapt to the shape of the aneurysm. As the
blood comes into contact with the coils, it begins to clot, gradually
filling up the aneurysm over time. This process effectively isolates the
aneurysm from the rest of the circulatory system, thus preventing it
from rupturing. The coils are left in place and do not need to be
removed.</p>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Illustration demonstrating coil
embolisation of a brain aneurysm.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>After the coils are properly placed, the catheter is carefully
withdrawn from the body. The patient is usually required to stay in the
hospital for the night following the procedure to enable the medical
team to monitor the recovery.</p>

inserted, ensuring that blood no longer fills it.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2 id="what-is-stent-assisted-coiling">What is stent assisted
coiling?</h2>
<p>Stent-assisted coiling involves the insertion of a small, mesh-like
tube called a stent in addition to coils.</p>
<p>Similar to coil embolisation, a tiny catheter is navigated through
the blood vessels, starting from an access point typically in the wrist
or groin, all the way up to the site of the aneurysm in the brain. The
stent is then placed across the opening of the aneurysm, acting like a
small scaffold that provides support to the blood vessel wall, which can
be weakened due to the aneurysm.</p>
<p>Once the stent is in place, small coils are threaded through the
catheter and placed into the aneurysm. The coils promote blood clotting,
thereby filling the aneurysm and preventing it from rupturing. The stent
helps to hold these coils in place and prevents them from slipping into
the normal blood vessel. It’s particularly useful in treating wide-neck
aneurysms, where the risk of coils slipping into the parent vessel (the
blood vessel supplying the aneurysm) is higher. The stent also typically
increases the durability of the procedure, reducing the risk of
recurrence.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/stent-coiling.svg"
alt="Illustration of aneurysm coiling." />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Illustration of aneurysm
coiling.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>After the procedure, you will likely need to take a course of
antiplatelet medications such as clopidogrel, in addition to aspirin.
These help to prevent the formation of blood clots around the stent.
This is a routine precaution and an important part of ensuring the
success of the procedure. Antiplatelet medications are given in low
doses and make the platelets in your blood less sticky, reducing the
chance that a clot will form. These are often stopped at 6 months, with
aspirin continuing for 1-2 years.</p>

</figure>
<h2 id="what-is-flow-diversion">What is flow diversion?</h2>
<p>Flow diversion is another minimally invasive endovascular treatment
designed to manage brain aneurysms. The primary aim of this treatment is
to divert blood flow away from the aneurysm and therefore prevent
rupture.</p>
<p>A flow diverter, similar to a stent, is a small tubular mesh device
that’s placed inside the parent artery, the blood vessel supplying the
aneurysm. The flow diverter is designed to alter the blood flow dynamics
in the artery, thereby diverting blood away from the aneurysm. They can
be used with or without placement of coils in the aneurysm.</p>
<p>Over time, this decreased blood flow into the aneurysm encourages the
formation of a blood clot within the aneurysm, which helps to seal it
off from the rest of the blood vessel. As the aneurysm shrinks and
heals, the artery regains a more normal shape and function. This process
can take several weeks to months.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/flow-diversion.svg" alt="Flow diversion." />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Flow diversion.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Flow diversion is particularly effective for recurrent, large,
wide-necked, or thrombosed aneurysms that can’t be adequately treated
with other methods. It is also necessary to take a course of
antiplatelet medications after insertion of flow diverters.</p>

</figure>
<h2 id="what-is-an-intrasaccular-device">What is an intrasaccular
device?</h2>
<p>Intrasaccular devices such as the WEB (Woven EndoBridge) device may
be used in the treatment of wide neck aneurysms which would otherwise
require stents or flow diverters.</p>
<p>The WEB device, made of ultra-fine braided wires, is a flexible,
self-expanding mesh that resembles a tiny basket. It is introduced into
the aneurysm using a catheter navigated through the blood vessels from a
small incision usually made in the wrist or groin. Once inside the
aneurysm, the WEB device expands to fit the shape and size of the
aneurysm, serving as a barrier that disrupts the blood flow within. This
promotes clot formation within the aneurysm, sealing it off and
isolating it from the rest of the circulation, thereby reducing or
eliminating the risk of rupture.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/web-device.svg" alt="The WEB intrasaccular device." />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">The WEB intrasaccular
device.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A benefit of the WEB device is related to post-procedure medications.
With stents or flow diverters, patients are typically required to take
antiplatelet medications for a period of time to prevent blood clot
formation around the treatment site. However, because of the way the WEB
sits in the aneurysm itself rather than the blood vessel, patients
usually do not need to take these medications.</p>
<h2 id="is-endovascular-treatment-durable">Is endovascular treatment
durable?</h2>
<p>Endovascular treatment is highly effective at permanently eliminating
the aneurysm and providing lifelong protection from rupture. For this
reason it is now the most common method to treat brain aneurysms
worldwide and has been employed to save countless lives.</p>
<p>In preventing adverse consequences such as disability or death
endovascular treatment is comparable surgical clipping. It is the
recommended treatment in ruptured aneurysms as studies have shown that
endovascular treatment is safer.</p>
<p>However whilst very high, as with every medical treatment, including
surgical clipping, the success rate is not 100%. In a large study at
least one further treatment was necessary in 4.9% of patients to
eliminate the risk from the aneurysm. For this reason, endovascularly
treated aneurysms are monitored with follow-up scans for a period of
time to ensure that the aneurysm is eliminated. If a further treatment
is required this can normally be performed safely in a planned elective
setting also with an endovascular procedure.</p>
<p>The key benefit arises from the low invasiveness of the procedure,
reducing harm incurred during the treatment itself.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-the-risks-of-endovascular-treatment">What are the risks
of endovascular treatment?</h2>
<p>Endovascular embolisation of aneurysms is normally performed
successfully without complication, but all medical treatments carry the
potential for risk.</p>
<p>Recovery is usually relatively rapid after endovascular treatment.
Patients typically spend one night in hospital for monitoring and are
discharged the day after. The site of arterial entry in the wrist or
groin might be sore for a few days when it heals. Rarely there are minor
side effects like oozing or bleeding from these sites. Applying pressure
usually stops this. A small, typically temporary bruise may also form.
Occasionally the patient might experience headaches that typically
settle over days to weeks.</p>
<p>Serious but rare risks include a 5% chance of stroke from the
procedure due to aneurysm rupture or blood vessel occlusion, causing
potential limb weakness, speech or vision difficulty which could be
temporary or permanent. A very rare 1% risk of a severe brain injury
leading to death exists. There is a small chance of vessel damage in the
groin or wrist from the catheter entry necessitating surgery.</p>
