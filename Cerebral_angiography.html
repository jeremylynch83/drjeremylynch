        <h1 id="cerebral-angiography">Cerebral angiography</h1>
        <h2 id="what-is-a-cerebral-angiogram">What is a cerebral
        angiogram?</h2>
        <p>An angiogram is an X-ray test that produces high-resolution
        images of the blood vessels. Cerebral angiograms produce imaging
        of the blood vessels of the head and neck.</p>
        <p>The test involves insertion of a tube in the groin or wrist
        that is then navigated through the body to the vessel of
        interest. An iodine based dye (known as ‘contrast’) is then
        injected through the tube.</p>
        <p>Why is cerebral angiography performed?</p>
        <p>Cerebral angiograms are commonly performed to diagnose
        diseases of the blood vessels such as:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Cerebral aneurysms</p></li>
        <li><p>Carotid stenosis</p></li>
        <li><p>Dural arteriovenous fistulas</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>They are also used to follow-up diseases previously
        treated.</p>
        <h2 id="why-not-just-do-a-ct-or-mri">Why not just do a CT or
        MRI?</h2>
        <p>The image quality is often superior when using angiography,
        allowing the discovery of diseases that do not show up on
        alternative scans and allowing the planning of certain
        procedures. As CT and MRI scans are safer, faster, and usually
        more pleasant to undergo we only do cerebral angiograms when we
        need to. Having said that, generally the risk (and degree of
        unpleasantness) is not usually very great.</p>
        <h2 id="can-i-eat-or-drink-before-the-procedure">Can I eat or
        drink before the procedure?</h2>
        <p>In some hospitals you may be given instructions not to eat or
        drink for a few hours before the procedure. This main reason for
        this is just in case general anaesthesia or sedation is needed
        during the procedure. Anaesthetists ideally do not like you to
        have food or drink in the stomach if you are to have general
        anaesthesia as there is a risk of regurgitation in to the
        lungs.</p>
        <p>Having said this, the great majority of angiograms do not
        require general anaesthesia or sedation and so in many other
        hospitals you are allowed to have a light breakfast before
        coming to hospital and drink clear fluids until the examination.
        Exact instructions will be given to you before your
        angiogram.</p>
        <h2 id="should-i-take-my-normal-medications">Should I take my
        normal medications?</h2>
        <p>You should your medication as usual unless instructed
        otherwise (this includes any aspirin-based or anti-platelet
        medication, for example clopidogrel). You can take your normal
        medication with small sips of water.</p>
        <h2 id="i-have-allergies.-can-i-still-take-the-test">I have
        allergies. Can I still take the test?</h2>
        <p>It is important to inform the staff if you have any
        allergies. It is especially important to mention allergies
        to:</p>
        <p>Iodine or iodine based contrast agents.</p>
        <p>Latex.</p>
        <p>Plasters.</p>
        <p>Cleaning solutions such as chlorhexidine.</p>
        <h2 id="can-i-have-an-angiogram-if-i-am-pregnant">Can I have an
        angiogram if I am pregnant?</h2>
        <p>Cerebral angiograms involve small doses of radiation, but
        usually directed towards the head. The dose to any developing
        foetus is very low, and can be further lowered by wearing
        protective lead clothing. Angiograms are sometimes performed in
        emergency settings where there may be a danger to the mother if
        they are not performed. However, if the procedure can be avoided
        by performing an alternative test, or delayed until after the
        pregnancy this is preferred. If you are pregnant, trying to get
        pregnant, or if there is any chance that you could possibly be
        pregnant however unlikely, please inform the staff.</p>
        <h2 id="what-is-it-like-to-have-an-angiogram">What is it like to
        have an angiogram?</h2>
        <p>At least a few days before the procedure you would have
        routine blood tests performed.</p>
        <p>Typically you would enter the hospital on the day of the
        procedure. A nurse will go through your medical history. You
        will then be given a gown to wear during the procedure and
        remove your underwear. You will then be consented for the
        procedure by a doctor. You should use the toilet before the
        procedure.</p>
        <p>The angiogram is done in a dedicated angiography suite where
        you will lie flat on the table. In the room there will be
        members of the team who help to perform the procedure, including
        a nurse, a radiographer/technologist (who will help operate the
        machine), and a doctor (usually an interventional
        neuroradiologist) who will perform the procedure.</p>
        <p>The wrist or groin is usually the site that is used for
        delivery of the instruments for the procedure and this is shaved
        and cleaned with sterile solution. Drapes are then placed around
        the site. The doctor will inject a small amount of local
        anaesthesia (which unfortunately stings when it goes in) to numb
        the skin. They will then insert a plastic tube in to the artery
        and navigate a long thin plastic tube called a catheter through
        the body and in to the blood vessels of the neck. Through this
        tube ‘contrast’ dye is injected whilst performing an X-ray to
        obtain images of the blood vessels. You do not feel the tube as
        it passes through the blood vessels in your body as they have no
        sensory receptors. You may feel some pushing and pulling at the
        groin.</p>
        <p>The x-ray machines will move into position over your head.
        They will move around you during the procedure but will not
        touch you. You may experience funny sensations such as flashing
        lights in the eyes, hot or cold over the side of the face, a
        funny taste in the mouth, or pressure at the back of the head
        during the examination. These are all normal and tend to pass
        within a few seconds.. They result from the contrast dye
        travelling through the blood vessels. The whole examination
        usually takes less than an hour, although the time can be
        variable due to the ease or difficulty of the procedure.</p>
        <p>It is very important you stay still throughout the procedure
        to ensure the pictures taken are as clear as possible. If you
        feel unwell or in pain please let us know. You can talk to your
        doctor during the exam.</p>
        <p>After all the imaging is finished the tube in the access site
        is removed. If the puncture site was the groin sometimes a
        collagen “plug” is used to seal the blood vessel. Alternatively,
        usually just applying firm pressure to the blood vessel for 10
        minutes is sufficient as the hole is fairly small. If the
        puncture site was the wrist then an inflatable compression
        device is applied for a few hours after.</p>
        <h2 id="what-happens-after-the-exam">What happens after the
        exam?</h2>
        <p>You will be monitored by a nurse for a few hours after the
        angiogram. If the access site was the groin you will be
        instructed to lie flat for a variable length of time (typically
        over 1 hour but less than 6 hours). The nursing staff will carry
        out regular observations, including checking your groin site and
        foot pulses. You should be able to eat and drink on returning to
        the ward, but please check with nursing staff first. Sometimes
        patients experience some bruising around the groin. This is
        nothing to worry about and will fade over a few days.</p>
        <p>Most people can go home on the same day as the procedure. It
        is not advised to use public transport after you’ve had an
        angiogram in case you feel unwell, so it’s important that you
        make arrangements for someone to collect you from the ward and
        take you home by car.</p>
        <h2 id="what-should-i-do-when-i-return-home">What should I do
        when I return home?</h2>
        <p>You should make advance arrangements for someone to stay with
        you for 24 hours after you get home. To avoid provoking bleeding
        at the access site avoid strenuous activities such as heavy
        lifting, running and cycling for 1 week. Do not operate
        machinery or drive for 48 hours.</p>
        <h2 id="when-will-i-receive-the-results">When will I receive the
        results?</h2>
        <p>Sometimes the doctor can tell you at the end of the
        procedure. It is not unusual, however, for it to be necessary
        for the images to be analysed on a computer before they can be
        interpreted. In this case the final results will be delivered
        later at a clinic attendance or over the phone.</p>
        <h2 id="does-the-procedure-involve-any-risk">Does the procedure
        involve any risk?</h2>
        <p>A cerebral angiogram is considered safe, however any medical
        procedure can involve small risks. It is important to understand
        that the risks involved in not undertaking the test (for
        example, non-diagnosis of a serious disease) usually outweigh
        the small risks of the procedure.</p>
        <p>The main potential complication of cerebral angiography is of
        having a stroke, with a rate of approximately 0.5% (or 1 in 200
        people). This risk varies with a few different factors and would
        likely be lower if you are normally in good health and not very
        elderly. The symptoms can involve one or more of the following:
        weakness of the face, arms, or legs; difficulty with speech; or
        difficulty with vision. Strokes can also be of variable
        severity: from brief and barely noticeable to very severe. They
        can also be temporary or result in permanent deficit. The good
        news is that strokes that result from cerebral angiogram often
        tend to be of the lesser severity with good potential for
        recovery. As strokes tend to occur during, or shortly after the
        procedure you are also in the best place (under direct medical
        supervision) if they were to occur.</p>
        <p>The second main risk is of damage to artery at the access
        site. It is common to get small amounts of bleeding after the
        procedure and this usually stops spontaneously. If the bleeding
        is heavier or if there is internal bleeding then sometimes
        special injections or surgery is required. It is rare for this
        to be necessary, however. Very rarely the artery can become
        blocked, resulting in not enough blood getting to the leg. This
        condition requires surgery to remedy.</p>
