id="treatment-of-davf">Treatment of DAVF</h1>
<h2 id="how-can-endovascular-treatment-help">How can endovascular
treatment help?</h2>
<p>“Endovascular” means that access to the brain or surroundings is
achieved by threading a very fine tube through your arteries.
Embolisation is a way of blocking abnormal blood vessels and is usually
carried out to prevent the DAVF from bleeding. This is done by injecting
a special glue-like liquid into the DAVF to cut off the blood vessels
supplying the fistula.</p>
<p>Endovascular treatment is performed by specialist doctors called
interventional neuroradiologists (INRs)</p>
<p>If the DAVF is particularly large or complex, an embolisation may be
performed prior to further surgical excision (removal) of the lesion to
reduce blood flow to the DAVF and ensure that further surgical treatment
is safer.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-the-risks-of-davf-embolisation">What are the risks of
DAVF embolisation?</h2>
<p>All treatments and procedures have risks associated with them. Risks
may vary depending on the size, position, and configuration of the blood
vessels. Rarely it is not possible to embolise a DAVF safely.</p>
<p>During the DAVF embolisation a contrast agent (iodine based) will be
injected into the arteries. This allows for the doctor to visualise the
blood vessels when an X-Ray is taken. Contrast agents are considered
safe but have the potential to cause an allergic reaction. The
department and team are well equipped to deal with reactions in the rare
event of this happening. It is important that you contact the department
as soon as possible before your procedure if you have reacted to an
x-ray contrast agent before or have severe asthma and have been admitted
to hospital with an asthma attack in the past year. The contrast agent
is excreted through the kidneys and may affect the kidney function after
the procedure. This is more common in patients with pre-existing kidney
dysfunction and some patients will have a blood test to test the kidney
function beforehand to ensure that it is safe to have contrast. The
procedure will need to take place under a general anaesthetic. The
anaesthetist will discuss the risks of general anaesthesia with you.</p>
<p>DAVF embolisation may be a complex procedure. Serious complications
are rare but possible:</p>
<p>The procedure may cause a stroke, the risk varies but is in the range
of approximately 5% (1 in 20 patients) in most cases. This may be caused
by rupture of the aneurysm during treatment or occlusion of blood
vessels. Strokes can take different forms but most commonly involve
weakness in the arms or legs and difficulty with speech or vision. This
may be temporary or permanent, mild or severe. There is a very rare risk
of catastrophic brain injury resulting in death of approximately 1% (1
in 100 patients).</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The use of X-rays during any procedure results in a very small
increase in the risk of developing cancer in the future. Very rarely
there is temporary hair loss and skin reddening that may occur up to a
few weeks after the procedure.. We make every effort to reduce radiation
dose to as low as possible.</p></li>
<li><p>We are required by law to ask patients of childbearing capacity
between the ages of 12 and 55 years are required by law to be asked
about the possibility of pregnancy when undergoing examinations
involving x-ray. In the urgent case of a thrombectomy, the procedure
will most likely still go ahead but with additional precautions in
place. .</p></li>
<li><p>The small bruise at the place where the needle is inserted
(usually the groin or wrist) may become large and uncomfortable and you
may need more treatment, including surgery.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="are-there-any-alternatives">Are there any alternatives?</h2>
<p>Surgical excision is an alternative. This involves making an incision
in the skull (craniotomy) to allow the surgeon to access the DAVF. The
feeding arteries and draining veins that remain in the brain are then
clipped off. Surgery is a well established and effective treatment and
can provide protection from DAVF rupture or haemorrhage. Surgical
excision has its own specific risks and your neurosurgeon will discuss
these in detail with you.</p>
<h2 id="what-happens-during-the-embolisation-procedure">What happens
during the embolisation procedure?</h2>
<p>The DAVF embolisation is performed while you are under a general
anaesthetic. The anaesthetic team will put you to sleep prior to the
procedure. The procedure is performed by your doctor in the angiography
suite in the neuroradiology department and it usually takes between one
and three hours. A dedicated team of radiologists, radiographers,
anaesthetists, and nurses in the angiography suite will monitor you
closely throughout the procedure.</p>
<p>Once the procedure has started your doctor will place a thin flexible
plastic tube (catheter) into the femoral artery in the groin or artery
in the wrist. The catheter then passes through the main artery in the
body called the aorta and finally into the arteries in the neck and
brain (cerebral arteries). When the most accessible feeding blood vessel
is identified, further catheters (including a microcatheter) are placed
inside the first catheter and into this artery and up to the point of
the fistulous connection. Embolic material (glue-like) is then injected
into this point to obliterate the DAVF. Occasionally small platinum
coils will be used in addition. The embolic material creates an
artificial blood clot and blocks further blood flowing into the DAVF.
X-Rays are taken during the procedure to ensure the DAVF is
obliterated.</p>
<p>After the procedure the catheters are removed and the blood vessel in
the groin or wrist is sealed off with a collagen plug or manual
compression to prevent bleeding.</p>
<p>The procedure usually takes 2–3 hours.</p>
<h2 id="will-it-hurt">Will it hurt?</h2>
<p>The procedure is done under a general anaesthetic and therefore you
should not feel any pain. Sometimes it can be uncomfortable around the
wrist or groin access site afterwards, but usually this settles with
simple analgesics.</p>
<h2 id="what-happens-after-the-embolisation">What happens after the
embolisation?</h2>
<p>When you arrive on the ward you will need to stay in bed for a few
hours to recover. During this time, the ward nurse will check you
regularly, including looking at the site where you had the catheter put
into your groin, to make sure there is no bleeding. If you do have
bleeding, we will ask you to stay in bed resting a bit longer. You may
have some bruising around your groin, which can be sore, but most people
have little or no after effects.</p></div>
