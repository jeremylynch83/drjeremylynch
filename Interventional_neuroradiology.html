        neuroradiology</h1>
        <h2 id="what-is-an-interventional-neuroradiology-doctor">What is
        an interventional neuroradiology doctor?</h2>
        <p>Interventional neuroradiologists, otherwise known as
        neurointerventional radiologists, neurointerventionalists, or
        endovascular neurosurgeons, are doctors who perform procedures
        upon the brain or spine without making large incisions. Instead
        the minimally invasive procedures are performed through the
        blood vessels, or through small needles. The use of “neuro” in
        “Neurointerventional” means we particularly focus on treatments
        for disease or disorders of the nervous system located within
        the head, neck and spine systems of the body. They use advanced
        imaging equipment to guide their procedures.</p>
        <h2 id="are-interventional-neuroradiologists-surgeons">Are
        interventional neuroradiologists surgeons?</h2>
        <p>Interventional neuroradiology procedures are complex
        procedures requiring a high degree of manual dexterity and
        anatomical knowledge and many years of training. Another name
        for the specialty is endovascular neurosurgery. A distinction is
        often made from the more traditional open microvascular
        neurosurgery which involves making incisions in the skull to
        perform procedures under a microscope.</p>
        <p>Many practitioners come from a background in radiology, which
        might seem odd at first. However, the specialty evolved from
        first performing diagnostic procedures, called angiograms, by
        injecting substances into the bloodstream to visualise diseases.
        After many advances in techniques and technology practitioners
        were able to actually treat diseases using tiny instruments
        directly inside the blood vessels themselves. As well as
        radiology, practitioners may also have backgrounds in
        neurosurgery, and neurology.</p>
        <h2
        id="are-these-techniques-safe-or-are-they-considered-experimental">Are
        these techniques safe or are they considered experimental?</h2>
        <p>Interventional neuroradiology employs techniques that have
        been proven, through rigorous clinical trials, to be safe and
        effective. Many vascular diseases of the brain and spine,
        previously treated through open surgery, can now be treated with
        reduced complication rates associated with the interventional
        neuroradiology. As an added benefit there is usually reduced
        pain and shorter recovery time. Neurointerventionalists work
        closely with other specialists including neurosurgeons to ensure
        that the correct treatment is chosen. Many of our patients are
        referred to us by our surgical colleagues who also recognize the
        benefits of minimally invasive treatments.</p>
        <h2
        id="what-are-the-most-common-types-of-diseases-that-are-treated">What
        are the most common types of diseases that are treated?</h2>
        <p>There are many conditions treated by interventional
        neuroradiologists.</p>
        <p>Brain aneurysms are bulges on the wall of an artery. We treat
        them before they burst to prevent a stroke. In the emergency
        setting we also treat aneurysms that have already burst to stop
        further bleeding. Approximately 3% of the population have brain
        aneurysms, however not all of these are dangerous and need
        treating.</p>
        <p>We treat stroke patients by removing the clot which is
        blocking the artery in the brain. If this is done quickly enough
        (normally just a few hours after the stroke onset) then the
        prognosis is much better. Stroke is one of the leading causes of
        death in the United Kingdom.</p>
        <p>We treat stenosis (narrowing) in the blood vessels of the
        neck or brain using stents or balloons in order to increase the
        blood flow and prevent stroke.</p>
        <p>We treat a disease called arteriovenous fistula, which is an
        abnormal connection between arteries and veins within the brain
        or spine. This causes abnormally high pressure in the veins and
        can lead to symptoms such as tinnitus, vision or hearing loss,
        or stroke. A related condition, known as arteriovenous
        malformation, can also often be treated using interventional
        techniques.</p>
        <p>We often treat patients with tumours of the brain, face, or
        neck who are going to have a surgical resection. We can often
        shrink the tumour down by blocking the blood flow (embolisation)
        using tiny particles.</p>
        <p>A common procedure that we perform is called a cerebral
        angiogram. “Cerebral” meaning brain, “angio-” meaning blood
        vessel, and “-gram” indicating that an X-ray is being performed.
        This is a diagnostic, minimally invasive procedure to diagnose
        diseases of the blood vessels of the brain.</p>
        <h2
        id="how-do-interventional-neuroradiologists-perform-their-procedures">How
        do interventional neuroradiologists perform their
        procedures?</h2>
        <p>This is achieved via inserting a tiny tube called a catheter
        into an artery or vein. The usual entrance site is the groin or
        the wrist, as these are easily accessible and safe places. We
        then advance the tube into the blood vessel involved in the
        disease process. We can place tiny devices, such as coils or
        stents, or retrieve blood clots, through these tubes. As the
        tubes inside the body we use advanced imaging equipment, such as
        X-rays, CT, or MRI to guide them.</p>
