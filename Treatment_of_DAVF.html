        <h1 id="treatment-of-davf">Treatment of DAVF</h1>
        <h2 id="how-can-endovascular-treatment-help">How can
        endovascular treatment help?</h2>
        <p>“Endovascular” means that access to the brain or surroundings
        is achieved by threading a very fine tube through your arteries.
        Embolisation is a way of blocking abnormal blood vessels and is
        usually carried out to prevent the DAVF from bleeding. This is
        done by injecting a special glue-like liquid into the DAVF to
        cut off the blood vessels supplying the fistula.</p>
        <p>Endovascular treatment is performed by specialist doctors
        called interventional neuroradiologists (INRs)</p>
        <p>If the DAVF is particularly large or complex, an embolisation
        may be performed prior to further surgical excision (removal) of
        the lesion to reduce blood flow to the DAVF and ensure that
        further surgical treatment is safer.</p>
        <h2 id="what-are-the-risks-of-davf-embolisation">What are the
        risks of DAVF embolisation?</h2>
        <p>All treatments and procedures have risks associated with
        them. Risks may vary depending on the size, position, and
        configuration of the blood vessels. Rarely it is not possible to
        embolise a DAVF safely.</p>
        <p>During the DAVF embolisation a contrast agent (iodine based)
        will be injected into the arteries. This allows for the doctor
        to visualise the blood vessels when an X-Ray is taken. Contrast
        agents are considered safe but have the potential to cause an
        allergic reaction. The department and team are well equipped to
        deal with reactions in the rare event of this happening. It is
        important that you contact the department as soon as possible
        before your procedure if you have reacted to an x-ray contrast
        agent before or have severe asthma and have been admitted to
        hospital with an asthma attack in the past year. The contrast
        agent is excreted through the kidneys and may affect the kidney
        function after the procedure. This is more common in patients
        with pre-existing kidney dysfunction and some patients will have
        a blood test to test the kidney function beforehand to ensure
        that it is safe to have contrast. The procedure will need to
        take place under a general anaesthetic. The anaesthetist will
        discuss the risks of general anaesthesia with you.</p>
        <p>DAVF embolisation may be a complex procedure. Serious
        complications are rare but possible:</p>
        <p>The procedure may cause a stroke, the risk varies but is in
        the range of approximately 5% (1 in 20 patients) in most cases.
        This may be caused by rupture of the aneurysm during treatment
        or occlusion of blood vessels. Strokes can take different forms
        but most commonly involve weakness in the arms or legs and
        difficulty with speech or vision. This may be temporary or
        permanent, mild or severe. There is a very rare risk of
        catastrophic brain injury resulting in death of approximately 1%
        (1 in 100 patients).</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>The use of X-rays during any procedure results in a very
        small increase in the risk of developing cancer in the future.
        Very rarely there is temporary hair loss and skin reddening that
        may occur up to a few weeks after the procedure.. We make every
        effort to reduce radiation dose to as low as possible.</p></li>
        <li><p>We are required by law to ask patients of childbearing
        capacity between the ages of 12 and 55 years are required by law
        to be asked about the possibility of pregnancy when undergoing
        examinations involving x-ray. In the urgent case of a
        thrombectomy, the procedure will most likely still go ahead but
        with additional precautions in place. .</p></li>
        <li><p>The small bruise at the place where the needle is
        inserted (usually the groin or wrist) may become large and
        uncomfortable and you may need more treatment, including
        surgery.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="are-there-any-alternatives">Are there any
        alternatives?</h2>
        <p>Surgical excision is an alternative. This involves making an
        incision in the skull (craniotomy) to allow the surgeon to
        access the DAVF. The feeding arteries and draining veins that
        remain in the brain are then clipped off. Surgery is a well
        established and effective treatment and can provide protection
        from DAVF rupture or haemorrhage. Surgical excision has its own
        specific risks and your neurosurgeon will discuss these in
        detail with you.</p>
        <h2 id="what-happens-during-the-embolisation-procedure">What
        happens during the embolisation procedure?</h2>
        <p>The DAVF embolisation is performed while you are under a
        general anaesthetic. The anaesthetic team will put you to sleep
        prior to the procedure. The procedure is performed by your
        doctor in the angiography suite in the neuroradiology department
        and it usually takes between one and three hours. A dedicated
        team of radiologists, radiographers, anaesthetists, and nurses
        in the angiography suite will monitor you closely throughout the
        procedure.</p>
        <p>Once the procedure has started your doctor will place a thin
        flexible plastic tube (catheter) into the femoral artery in the
        groin or artery in the wrist. The catheter then passes through
        the main artery in the body called the aorta and finally into
        the arteries in the neck and brain (cerebral arteries). When the
        most accessible feeding blood vessel is identified, further
        catheters (including a microcatheter) are placed inside the
        first catheter and into this artery and up to the point of the
        fistulous connection. Embolic material (glue-like) is then
        injected into this point to obliterate the DAVF. Occasionally
        small platinum coils will be used in addition. The embolic
        material creates an artificial blood clot and blocks further
        blood flowing into the DAVF. X-Rays are taken during the
        procedure to ensure the DAVF is obliterated.</p>
        <p>After the procedure the catheters are removed and the blood
        vessel in the groin or wrist is sealed off with a collagen plug
        or manual compression to prevent bleeding.</p>
        <p>The procedure usually takes takes 2-3 hours.</p>
        <h2 id="will-it-hurt">Will it hurt?</h2>
        <p>The procedure is done under a general anaesthetic and
        therefore you should not feel any pain. Sometimes it can be
        uncomfortable around the wrist or groin access site afterwards,
        but usually this settles with simple analgesics.</p>
        <h2 id="what-happens-after-the-embolisation">What happens after
        the embolisation?</h2>
        <p>When you arrive on the ward you will need to stay in bed for
        a few hours to recover. During this time, the ward nurse will
        check you regularly, including looking at the site where you had
        the catheter put into your groin, to make sure there is no
        bleeding. If you do have bleeding, we will ask you to stay in
        bed resting a bit longer. You may have some bruising around your
        groin, which can be sore, but most people have little or no
        after effects.</p>
