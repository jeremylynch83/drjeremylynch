## What is an aneurysm?

An aneurysm is a bulge in the wall of a blood vessel caused by a small area of weakness. Aneurysms can occur in various parts of the body, but one of the most common locations is the brain. These are known as intracranial or cerebral aneurysms. Some aneurysms have the potential to rupture which can result in bleeding around the brain called subarachnoid haemorrhage.

![Illustration of a cerebral aneurysm. ](img/aneurysm.svg){#fig:aneurysm }

Brain aneurysms most commonly affect middle aged and older adults with a higher prevalence in women. They are extremely rare in children. The cause of a particular aneurysm usually is unknown, although some individuals have a genetic predisposition to developing them. Aneurysms can also rarely develop after certain infections or trauma.

## What is the prevalence of brain aneurysms?

Brain aneurysms are present in about 3% of the population (3 in 100 people). There are some factors that increase the risk of developing a brain aneurysm:

1. **Family history of brain aneurysm or subarachnoid haemorrhage (bleeding around the brain)**
2. **Atherosclerosis**: This is a condition characterised by the buildup of plaque in the arteries. It is associated with an increased risk of brain aneurysms.
3. **Smoking**: This can result in damage to the blood vessels due to chemicals inhaled.
4. **High blood pressure**: This causes greater pressure on the walls of blood vessels.
5. **Female gender**
6. **increased Age**
7. **Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD)**: This is a genetic condition leading to the development of multiple cysts in the kidneys. walls o bloodIt is also associated with brain aneurysms.
8. **Sickle cell disease**: This is a disorder of the red blood cells that is also associated with brain aneurysms.


## Are brain aneurysms dangerous?

Many aneurysms are benign, causing no symptoms and never rupturing. However, some do rupture, leading to life-threatening bleeding around the brain known as subarachnoid haemorrhage. Rarely, unruptured aneurysms cause symptoms such as impaired vision,  seizures, or strokes. These symptoms result from inflammation, pressure on nearby brain structures, or the formation of blood clots. Unfortunately, there is no test that can reliably predict which aneurysms will rupture or cause symptoms, though certain factors are known to increase the risk:

* **Aneurysm size**: Larger aneurysms carry a higher risk.
* **Location**: Aneurysms in the posterior circulation (e.g. basilar artery) are more prone to rupture.
* **Growth over time**: Increasing size on follow-up imaging suggests higher risk.
* **Previous rupture**: Patients who have had one ruptured aneurysm are at higher risk of another rupturing.
* **Family history**: A strong family history of aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage increases risk.
* **Smoking**: Significantly associated with both aneurysm formation and rupture.
* **Hypertension**: High blood pressure is a known risk factor.
* **Age and sex**: Rupture risk increases with age and is more common in females.
* **Aneurysm shape**: Irregular or lobulated shapes are more likely to rupture than smooth, round ones.

description: Key warning signs and differences between ruptured and unruptured aneurysms.

A brain aneurysm typically doesn't cause symptoms until it's very large or it ruptures.

## Ruptured Brain Aneurysm

Aneurysm rupture is a serious and dramatic event that is very noticeable. Commonly there is a severe headache, neck, pain, and sensitivity to light, which may be accompanied by loss of consciousness and patients are usually immediately brought to the hospital for further investigation and treatment.

Rarely, however, aneurysm rupture can produce less noticeable symptoms although typically, there is still a severe headache. If you have any concerns you should immediately contact emergency medical services, especially if you’re known to have a brain aneurysm.

## Unruptured Brain Aneurysm

In rare instances unruptured aneurysms symptoms might include:

* Pain above and behind an eye.
* Dilated pupil.
* Vision changes (e.g., double vision).
* Facial numbness.

## Computerised Tomography (CT Scan)

A CT scan utilises X-rays to create a detailed image of the brain. This technology is widely available, quick, and particularly effective in identifying bleeding in or around the brain, which can occur if an aneurysm ruptures. The scan may be performed with or without an iodinated 'contrast' dye, which helps in distinguishing different brain structures more clearly, such as the blood vessels. Although a CT scan does involve a small amount of radiation, the dosage is generally not high enough to pose a significant risk to the patient.

CT Angiography is a specialized CT scan that uses an injection of contrast dye to visualize the blood vessels, making it an effective tool in the diagnosis of brain aneurysms. It is usually possible to see the shape and size of an aneurysm, if present. The procedure is mostly non-invasive, other than the small injection required for the contrast.

CT scans involve being placed in a donut shaped machine. Scans usually take about 10 minutes.

## Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)

MRI and MR angiography (MRA) are techniques that generate high-resolution images of the brain and blood vessels respectively, without using X-rays. Instead, they use strong magnetic fields. These methods can can see certain aneurysms in more detail, and are used in the follow-up of embolised (but not clipped) aneurysms. However, they are generally slower, more expensive, and cannot be used on patients with certain metallic implants, due to the powerful magnets involved.

MRI scans involve being positioned in a tunnel and typically take 20-60 minutes.

## Cerebral Angiography

Cerebral angiography is a more invasive diagnostic procedure that uses X-rays to produce very high-resolution images of the brain's blood vessels, and it is the gold-standard method for identifying aneurysms. During this test, a small incision is made in the patient's groin or wrist, through which a catheter is guided to the blood vessels in the neck. Contrast dye is then injected through the catheter to visualize the aneurysm. This procedure provides the most detailed images of an aneurysm, but it is more invasive than MRI or CT/CTA scans. The major risk is of developing a stroke during the procedure, on the order of 0.5%.

## Lumbar Puncture

A lumbar puncture, often known as a spinal tap, is a medical procedure where a needle is inserted into the lower portion of the spine (the lumbar region) to extract a sample of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). This fluid envelops your brain and spinal cord, acting as a protective layer and facilitating a stable environment.

In the context of aneurysms, it is usually performed when doctors suspect an aneurysm as having ruptured but other imaging tests, such as a CT scan, aren't conclusive. This could be because the bleed was minimal, or the blood has already dispersed. During a lumbar puncture, the collected CSF is meticulously examined for the presence of blood or xanthochromia. The latter is a yellowish or pinkish discoloration that results from the breakdown of red blood cells in the CSF — both of these signs point towards a recent subarachnoid haemorrhage.

## What are the consequences of aneurysm rupture?

Aneurysm rupture results in a severe headache caused by bleeding around the brain, termed subarachnoid haemorrhage. A common description of this is a "thunderclap" headache. It may be accompanied by a stiff neck, sickness, vomiting, sensitivity to light, and loss of consciousness. Aneurysmal haemorrhage may lead to death. Rates of mortality vary in different studies and range from 20-50%. There is some evidence that the mortality rate from aneurysm rupture is decreasing over time due to advances in medical care.

![Ruptured aneurysm. ](img/ruptured_aneurysm.svg)

A patient with a ruptured aneurysm is admitted to hospital. In the initial phase, the individual is placed in an intensive care unit (ICU) where healthcare professionals can closely monitor their condition. The duration of the hospital stay will differ from person to person. Depending on the severity of the condition, it may range from a couple of weeks to a longer duration.

One complication that may arise after aneurysm rupture  is hydrocephalus. This condition is characterised by an accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the brain, leading to increased pressure, which could potentially affect brain function. Management of hydrocephalus is often tackled by temporary methods like external ventricular drains or more permanent solutions such as a shunt. A shunt serves to divert the CSF to another part of the body where it can be reabsorbed more effectively.

Another significant complication that may follow aneurysm rupture is cerebral vasospasm. This involves the narrowing of the brain's blood vessels, leading to reduced blood flow and potentially causing strokes and brain damage. Vasospasms usually occur a few days after the initial bleeding, making regular monitoring crucial. Medications, and sometimes additional procedures, are employed to mitigate this risk.


## How are ruptured aneurysms treated?

Ruptured aneurysms require immediate treatment to prevent further bleeding, as the consequences of this may be disastrous. Two techniques are available to achieve this. The primary and less invasive method is endovascular coiling. In this procedure, a catheter is inserted into a blood vessel and guided towards the aneurysm, whereupon small coils are released. These coils facilitate blood clotting, thus averting further rupture. The UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends endovascular treatment for aneurysmal rupture if it possible due to the significantly improved chance of survival following the treatment. In addition, patients have a higher likelihood of living independently coupled with a reduced risk of developing seizures. This is based on evidence from high-quality clinical trials such as the International Subarachnoid Aneurysm Trial conducted over a period of 16 years.

![Aneurysm coil embolisation. ](img/aneurysm coiling.svg)

The alternative method, surgical clipping, involves a neurosurgeon creating an opening in the skull and placing a metallic clip on the aneurysm's neck, effectively blocking the blood flow within. This is performed in the minority of cases where endovascular treatment is not possible.

![Aneurysm clipping. ](img/aneurysm-clipping.svg)


## What are the long-term consequences of aneurysm rupture?

It is possible to make a full recovery from aneurysm rupture. Unfortunately, some patients are left with permanent disabilities, such as weakness in the face, hands, or legs, or speech or visual difficulties. Patients may also experience more vague symptoms that persist over time, such as a reduced ability to concentrate and frequent headaches.

## I have an aneurysm. Does it need to be treated?

Not necessarily.

Aneurysms can be dangerous but some require no treatment at all. The decision to treat is often a complex one and requires discussion with an experienced medical professional. Any medical treatment involves a degree of risk, no matter how small. It is probable that for certain low-risk aneurysms the risk of the aneurysm is outweighed by the risk of the treatment.

For incidentally discovered unruptured brain aneurysms there are three broad management strategies:

1. Monitoring with scans: a period of observation may be undertaken to ensure the aneurysm is not growing or changing.
2. Endovascular treatment. This involves treating the aneurysm through the blood vessels. Generally, a small incision is made in the groin or wrist and a very thin tube is directed, under X-rays, into the aneurysm. Through this tube tiny coils and stents can be inserted to block off the aneurysm. This is less invasive and usually safer than surgical treatment.
3. Surgical clipping. This is an operation involving temporarily removing some of the skull bone ('craniotomy') to access the aneurysm and place a clip around its neck. It is by nature more invasive than endovascular treatment. The procedure is carried out with the use of an operating microscope.

There are no medications that can be given to shrink aneurysms, however stopping smoking and controlling blood pressure (if it is high) can reduce the risk of rupture.

## What factors might lead to an aneurysm being treated? {#factors}

* Symptoms: If the aneurysm is causing symptoms such as double vision or headaches. This is uncommon, however, as most aneurysms do not cause symptoms.
* Location: Aneurysms located in certain parts of the brain are more dangerous than others. This includes aneurysms within the ‘posterior' circulation, which includes the basilar, vertebral, and posterior cerebral arteries.
* Size: Larger aneurysms are more likely to rupture. This rule does not hold universally true, however, as it is not uncommon to see ruptured smaller aneurysms. Conversely large aneurysms in certain locations (such as cavernous aneurysms) are not thought to be very risky.
* Shape: Aneurysms with an irregular shape have been associated with increased rupture rates.
* Previous aneurysm rupture: If the aneurysm has previously ruptured, or the patient has other brain aneurysms which have bled before, then treatment is more likely to be recommended.
* High blood pressure: Blood pressure should be controlled in patients with aneurysms as it predisposes aneurysms to rupture.
* Smoking: Aneurysms are more likely to rupture in people who smoke and cessation is recommended if possible.


# Endovascular treatment of aneurysms {Aneurysms}

description: Minimally invasive procedures including coiling, stent-assisted coiling, flow diversion, and intrasaccular devices.

The development of endovascular techniques has completely revolutionised the treatment of brain aneurysms increasing the safety of the procedure and reducing the invasiveness and recovery time. The majority of brain aneurysms are now treated using endovascular techniques. There are very few aneurysms that cannot now be treated endovascularly.


## What does endovascular treatment involve?

Rather than requiring a large incision and direct surgical access to the aneurysm, endovascular treatment achieves its goal by guiding small, specialized devices through the patient's blood vessels (the body’s own natural highways) to the site of the aneurysm. Embolisation means to promote clot formation within the aneurysm, commonly by inserting devices such as coils into the aneurysm or placing stents acoss its neck.

## How does it work?

All endovascular treatments aim to initiate the body’s natural healing process and involve first filling the aneurysm with a stable clot. This seals off the aneurysm, preventing blood from entering it. The wall of the blood vessel remodels over time, completing the healing and eliminating the aneurysm.

## What are the types of endovascular treatment?


1. Coiling (Endovascular Coiling or Coil Embolization). This involves small, soft platinum coils being threaded through a catheter and placed directly into the aneurysm.
2. Stent-Assisted Coiling. Stents are  small, tube-shaped devices that are used in conjunction with coils to provide support to the weakened arterial wall. They also help keep the coils within the aneurysm sac. The stent remains in the artery permanently.
3. Flow Diversion. This treatment employs a device called a flow diverter, similar to a stent but with denser walls. It's placed in the artery carrying blood to the aneurysm. Instead of filling the aneurysm with coils, the flow diverter redirects blood flow away from the aneurysm. This reduced blood flow into the aneurysm promotes clotting within the aneurysm, leading to its closure. Coils are not mandatory but are sometimes also placed.
4. Intrasaccular devices such as the Woven Endobridge (WEB). These are placed directly into the aneurysm sac via a catheter, similar to coiling, but are able to treat aneurysms that would otherwise require stents.


## How is coil embolisation performed?

Coil embolisation is undertaken during general anaesthesia. The doctor  makes a small incision of about 3 mm, typically in the wrist or groin, to access a blood vessel. Following this, they insert a long, thin tube, called a catheter, through the incision into the blood vessel. Using a method called fluoroscopy, which involves real-time X-ray imaging, the doctor is able to navigate the catheter through the patient's vascular system until it reaches the blood vessels of the brain where the aneurysm is located.

Once the catheter is in position, small platinum coils are threaded through the catheter and into the aneurysm. These coils are soft and flexible, allowing them to adapt to the shape of the aneurysm. As the blood comes into contact with the coils, it begins to clot, gradually filling up the aneurysm over time. This process effectively isolates the aneurysm from the rest of the circulatory system, thus preventing it from rupturing. The coils are left in place and do not need to be removed.

![Illustration demonstrating coil embolisation of a brain aneurysm. ](img/aneurysm coiling.svg)

After the coils are properly placed, the catheter is carefully withdrawn from the body. The patient is usually required to stay in the hospital for the night following the procedure to enable the medical team to monitor the recovery.

(B) Angiography of the aneurysm is performed. (C) The aneurysm has had several coils inserted, ensuring that blood no longer fills it.  ](img/an_coiling.png){#fig:aneurysm_angio}


## What is stent assisted coiling?



Stent-assisted coiling involves the insertion of a small, mesh-like tube called a stent in addition to coils.

Similar to coil embolisation, a tiny catheter is navigated through the blood vessels, starting from an access point typically in the wrist or groin, all the way up to the site of the aneurysm in the brain. The stent is then placed across the opening of the aneurysm, acting like a small scaffold that provides support to the blood vessel wall, which can be weakened due to the aneurysm.

Once the stent is in place, small coils are threaded through the catheter and placed into the aneurysm. The coils promote blood clotting, thereby filling the aneurysm and preventing it from rupturing. The stent helps to hold these coils in place and prevents them from slipping into the normal blood vessel. It's particularly useful in treating wide-neck aneurysms, where the risk of coils slipping into the parent vessel (the blood vessel supplying the aneurysm) is higher. The stent also typically increases the durability of the procedure, reducing the risk of recurrence.



![Illustration of aneurysm coiling.](img/stent-coiling.svg)

After the procedure, you will likely need to take a course of antiplatelet medications such as clopidogrel, in addition to aspirin. These help to prevent the formation of blood clots around the stent. This is a routine precaution and an important part of ensuring the success of the procedure. Antiplatelet medications are given in low doses and make the platelets in your blood less sticky, reducing the chance that a clot will form. These are often stopped at 6 months, with aspirin continuing for 1-2 years.

(D) The aneurysm has been filled with coils. ](img/stent_coiling.png){#fig:aneurysm_angio}


## What is flow diversion?

Flow diversion is another minimally invasive endovascular treatment designed to manage brain aneurysms. The primary aim of this treatment is to divert blood flow away from the aneurysm and therefore prevent rupture.

A flow diverter, similar to a stent, is a small tubular mesh device that's placed inside the parent artery, the blood vessel supplying the aneurysm. The flow diverter is designed to alter the blood flow dynamics in the artery, thereby diverting blood away from the aneurysm. They can be used with or without placement of coils in the aneurysm.

Over time, this decreased blood flow into the aneurysm encourages the formation of a blood clot within the aneurysm, which helps to seal it off from the rest of the blood vessel. As the aneurysm shrinks and heals, the artery regains a more normal shape and function. This process can take several weeks to months.

![Flow diversion. ](img/flow-diversion.svg)


Flow diversion is particularly effective for recurrent, large, wide-necked, or thrombosed aneurysms that can't be adequately treated with other methods. It is also necessary to take a course of antiplatelet medications after insertion of flow diverters.

(C) The flow-diverting stent is seen from a different angle. (D) The stent is seen within the blood vessel. ](img/flow_diversion.png){#fig:aneurysm_angio}



## What is an intrasaccular device?

Intrasaccular devices such as the WEB (Woven EndoBridge) device may be used in the treatment of wide neck aneurysms which would otherwise require stents or flow diverters.

The WEB device, made of ultra-fine braided wires, is a flexible, self-expanding mesh that resembles a tiny basket. It is introduced into the aneurysm using a catheter navigated through the blood vessels from a small incision usually made in the wrist or groin. Once inside the aneurysm, the WEB device expands to fit the shape and size of the aneurysm, serving as a barrier that disrupts the blood flow within. This promotes clot formation within the aneurysm, sealing it off and isolating it from the rest of the circulation, thereby reducing or eliminating the risk of rupture.

![The WEB intrasaccular device.](img/web-device.svg)

A benefit of the WEB device is related to post-procedure medications. With stents or flow diverters, patients are typically required to take antiplatelet medications for a period of time to prevent blood clot formation around the treatment site. However, because of the way the WEB sits in the aneurysm itself rather than the blood vessel, patients usually do not need to take these medications.


## Is endovascular treatment durable?

Endovascular treatment is highly effective at permanently eliminating the aneurysm and providing lifelong protection from rupture. For this reason it is now the most common method to treat brain aneurysms worldwide and has been employed to save countless lives.

In preventing adverse consequences such as disability or death endovascular treatment is comparable surgical clipping. It is the recommended treatment in ruptured aneurysms as studies have shown that endovascular treatment is safer.

However whilst very high, as with every medical treatment, including surgical clipping, the success rate is not 100%. In a large study at least one further treatment was necessary in 4.9% of patients to eliminate the risk from the aneurysm. For this reason, endovascularly treated aneurysms are  monitored with follow-up scans for a period of time to ensure that the aneurysm is eliminated. If a further treatment is required this can normally be performed safely in a planned elective setting also with an endovascular procedure.

The key benefit arises from the low invasiveness of the procedure, reducing harm incurred during the treatment itself.


## What are the risks of endovascular treatment?

Endovascular embolisation of aneurysms is normally performed successfully without complication, but all medical treatments carry the potential for risk.

Recovery is usually relatively rapid after endovascular treatment. Patients typically spend one night in hospital for monitoring and are discharged the day after. The site of arterial entry in the wrist or groin might be sore for a few days when it heals. Rarely there are minor side effects like oozing or bleeding from these sites. Applying pressure usually stops this. A small, typically temporary bruise may also form. Occasionally the patient might experience headaches that typically settle over days to weeks.

Serious but rare risks include a 5% chance of stroke from the procedure due to aneurysm rupture or blood vessel occlusion, causing potential limb weakness, speech or vision difficulty which could be temporary or permanent. A very rare 1% risk of a severe brain injury leading to death exists. There is a small chance of vessel damage in the groin or wrist from the catheter entry necessitating surgery.

Surgical clipping is an established but more invasive method of treatment that still has a role in managing certain cerebral aneurysms. The procedure involves making an opening in the skull (a procedure called a craniotomy) to locate the aneurysm. With the help of a microscope, the surgeon places the clip on the aneurysm's neck, sealing it off from the rest of the blood vessel.

![Clipping of a cerebral aneurysm.](img/aneurysm-clipping.svg)

Recovery times vary but are typically longer than for endovascular treatment. Like all surgical procedures clipping carries some risks. Strokes occur in about 5-15% of cases which can manifest as weakness in the limbs, disturbances in speech, or visual problems. There is about a 1% chance of catastrophic brain injury resulting in death. The surgery might also affect the area of your brain near the aneurysm. This could lead to short-term effects due to swelling or bruising, or in rare cases, long-term effects. These effects would be specific to the location of each aneurysm and may also cause neurological stroke-like symptoms.

The procedure can lead to some physical discomfort in the days following the surgery. Swelling and bruising to the face are common, which might cause your eyes to close temporarily. Alongside this headaches are relatively common. The wound site can become infected. One unusual sensation some patients note is the feeling that the bone flap, the piece of bone removed during the surgery, seeming to move. This sensation, while strange, is not dangerous. The bone flap is secured with plates during the operation and will heal properly in time. The muscle used for chewing food might be impacted temporarily by the operation. As this muscle heals, you might find it challenging to open your mouth or chew, but these symptoms typically resolve within six months.

The period following the operation requires careful management of your activities. In the first few weeks after going home, it's essential to maintain a routine, stay hydrated, eat well, and rest regularly. Enlist help for household chores if possible and consider some gentle exercise to gradually build up your strength. Most people require about 2-3 months off work for full recovery. Returning to work earlier won't necessarily harm you, but it may prolong the recovery period due to increased tiredness.

However, in skilled hands, surgical clipping can provide a solution for many types of aneurysms, particularly those that may not be suitable for other treatments, like coil embolisation or flow diversion.
