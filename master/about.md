# About Dr Lynch {General}

## Biography

Dr Jeremy Lynch MBChB MRCS FRCR is a London-based Consultant Interventional Neuroradiologist. He has been an NHS doctor for 13 years and is experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of vascular diseases involving the brain, head and neck, and spine. Dr Lynch trained in Medicine at the University of Bristol and qualified in 2007. He underwent several years of surgical training, during which he gained membership of the Royal College of Surgeons. He then underwent further specialisation in interventional radiology and neuroradiology in a range of specialist hospitals in London including the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, Great Ormonds Street Hospital, Kings College Hospital, St George’s Hospital, and Queen’s Hospital. He underwent a further international fellowship in Toronto Western Hospital in Canada where he was one of the first doctors in the world to gain experience in robotic endovascular techniques.

Dr Lynch has published several academic book chapters and journal articles. He is a reviewer for Clinical Neuroradiology. His special interests include the role of new technologies including artificial intelligence in the diagnosis of neurovascular disease. He has been invited to lecture on interventional neuroradiology and neuroimaging in international conferences. He is the author of the popular neurointerventional educational website neurotool.org.

# Interventional neuroradiology

Interventional neuroradiology (otherwise known as neurointerventional radiology or endovascular neurosurgery) is a medical specialty that deals with minimally invasive treatments for diseases of the brain and spine involving blood vessels. Common conditions that are treated include brain aneurysms, strokes, carotid stenosis, and brain tumour embolisation.

# Terms and Conditions {General}

The content on this website is provided for general information and educational purposes only. It is not medical advice and should not be relied upon as such.

Accessing or reading this information does not create a doctor–patient relationship. A professional relationship is established only when you book and attend a consultation or clinic appointment through the appropriate booking channels.

While reasonable efforts are made to ensure that the information is accurate and up to date, no guarantee is given regarding its completeness, accuracy, reliability, or suitability for any particular purpose.

To the fullest extent permitted by law, the website owner accepts no liability for any loss, injury, or damage, whether direct or indirect, arising from use of this website or reliance on its content.

Users are strongly advised to seek advice from a qualified healthcare professional regarding any medical concerns or conditions. Never disregard or delay seeking medical advice because of information found on this website.

# Fees {General}

## Consultation Fees

The fee for an in-person consultation is £250 and for a virtual/telephone consultation it is £200. Follow-up consultations are £200. 

This covers a clinic appointment to discuss your condition, review relevant medical information, and provide specialist advice. Please note that this does not include the cost of any investigations, imaging, or procedures, which will be charged separately if required.

If you have private health insurance, the consultation fee may be covered by your insurer. Please note that you may still be responsible for any policy excess, co-payment, or shortfall depending on the terms of your cover. Self-paying patients are welcome and the consultation fee is payable before the appointment.

## CT or MRI Imaging Investigations

If a CT or MRI scan is required, this will be arranged at an appropriate facility. The cost of imaging investigations can vary depending on the type of scan and the provider, and is therefore charged separately from the consultation fee.

Patients with private health insurance will usually have the cost of imaging covered by their insurer, subject to the terms of their policy. Self-paying patients will be advised of the likely cost before proceeding.

## Cerebral or Spinal Angiography

In some cases, an angiogram may be recommended to obtain detailed images of the blood vessels in the brain or spine. This is a specialist procedure carried out in a hospital setting under local anaesthetic, with X-ray guidance.

As this is a more complex investigation, the cost can vary depending on the hospital and specific requirements.

Patients with private health insurance will usually have the procedure covered by their insurer, subject to the terms of their policy (including any excess or shortfall). Self-paying patients will be provided with an estimate of costs before the procedure is arranged.

##  Treatments such as Embolisation

In some cases, treatment of a vascular condition may be recommended using minimally invasive techniques such as endovascular embolisation. These are highly specialised procedures performed in hospital under imaging guidance.

The cost of such procedures will vary depending on the nature and complexity of the treatment, as well as any additional requirements such as anaesthesia, hospital stay, or follow-up care.

Patients with private health insurance will usually have these treatments covered by their insurer, subject to the terms of their policy (including any excess or shortfall). Self-paying patients will be provided with a clear estimate before proceeding.

# Cancellations {General}

If you are unable to attend a booked appointment, please provide at least 48 hours’ notice of cancellation. This allows the appointment to be offered to another patient.

Cancellations made with less than 48 hours’ notice, or non-attendance without prior notice, may incur a cancellation fee at the discretion of the clinic.

If the doctor needs to cancel or reschedule an appointment, all reasonable efforts will be made to notify you as soon as possible and to offer an alternative appointment. No liability is accepted for any costs or inconvenience arising from such changes.

By booking an appointment, you acknowledge and agree to these terms.
