## Surgical clipping

Treatment began in the 20th century with open surgery. Surgeons performed clipping, placing a small metal clip across the aneurysm’s neck to seal it. Open surgical clipping of intracranial aneurysms was pioneered in the early twentieth century, with Walter Dandy performing the first successful neck-clipping in 1937. Early procedures carried high risks because of poor visualisation, limited clip designs and inadequate anaesthesia. The introduction of the operating microscope in the late 1950s allowed surgeons to work with far greater precision, while the development of refined craniotomy approaches and more sophisticated clip designs reduced complications and improved vessel preservation. Advances in angiography, CT and MR imaging, along with intraoperative fluorescence techniques, further enhanced accuracy and safety. Modern anaesthesia and intensive care support also played a crucial role in lowering mortality. Over the decades, these innovations transformed clipping from a hazardous operation into a reliable and effective treatment, though its role has more recently been shared with less invasive endovascular methods.

## Endovascular treatment 

Endovascular treatment works from inside the blood vessels, usually by passing a thin tube from the wrist or groin up to the brain. The first breakthrough came in 1990 with Guglielmi detachable coils, which allowed aneurysms to be packed internally. In 1997, Jacques Moret introduced balloon remodelling, and the same year saw the first stent-assisted coiling, opening the door to treating wider-necked aneurysms. The pivotal ISAT trial in 2002 showed that for ruptured aneurysms suitable for either approach, coiling gave better long-term outcomes than clipping. 

## Flow diverters

In 2007, the arrival of flow-diverter stents transformed practice, offering durable reconstruction for large, giant, wide-necked, fusiform or recurrent aneurysms. Flow diverters are fine-mesh tubes placed across the aneurysm neck inside the parent artery, reducing inflow, encouraging clotting within the sac, and promoting vessel healing.

## Intrasaccular devices

The most recent development are intrasaccular devices. These sit inside the aneurysm itself at the neck, blocking blood entry without the need for a permanent stent. This makes them attractive in bifurcation aneurysms, since long-term dual antiplatelet therapy can usually be avoided. 

Intrasaccular devices sit inside the aneurysm itself, typically at the neck, to block inflow. Many of these do not require a permanent stent, so long-term dual antiplatelet therapy is often unnecessary. They are especially attractive for bifurcation aneurysms where two vessels branch at the aneurysm neck. Some evidence suggests intrasaccular devices are the safest way to treat cerebral aneurysms. 

* **WEB (Woven EndoBridge, MicroVention)**. The first widely used option, introduced in 2011. It is a soft braided mesh that fills the aneurysm neck. WEB often avoids stents and long-term dual antiplatelets. 
* **Contour and Neqstent (Stryker)**. Neck-bridging intrasaccular implants designed to plug the neck. Contour can be used alone in select cases, while Neqstent is intended to be combined with coils passed through its struts to complete occlusion. 
* **Artisse (Medtronic)**. A softer device than WEB when constrained, which can make deployment easier in shallow or angled aneurysms. Like WEB, it usually avoids long-term dual antiplatelets. 
* **Nautilus (EndoStream)**. One of the most recent devices. It provides neck coverage and a flow-disruption effect, then allows coiling through a central opening. Early series report high occlusion with minimal complications. It is not widely available yet. 

## What does this progress mean for patients?

Modern treatments now enable a broader range of aneurysm shapes and locations, with shorter recovery, lower complication rates in many scenarios, and durable results. Intrasaccular devices, in particular, reduce the need for permanent stents and strong antiplatelet medication, which is an advantage in both elective and ruptured cases when anatomy allows.


## Key takeaways

* Modern care offers **more options**: coiling, balloon-assisted coiling, **stent-assisted** coiling, **flow diverters**, and **intrasaccular devices**.
* **Flow diverters** give **durable** occlusion for large, wide-necked and complex aneurysms.
* **Intrasaccular devices** like **WEB**, **Artisse**, **Contour/Neqstent**, and **Nautilus** often **avoid stents** and long-term dual antiplatelets, while achieving high occlusion rates.
* Since **ISAT**, many ruptured aneurysms suitable for either approach are treated **endovascularly**, with better long-term outcomes than clipping.
* Overall, endovascular therapy is becoming **safer** and **more durable**, with **shorter recovery** for many patients.

# How long do you need to stay in hospital for a brain aneurysm? {features}

If you are told you have a brain aneurysm, one of the first questions you may ask is how long you might need to stay in hospital for treatment. The answer depends on whether the aneurysm has **ruptured** (bled) or is **unruptured** (found before bleeding).

We will begin by discussing **unruptured aneurysms**, treated electively (planned in advance). These are usually found incidentally on a brain scan. Not all need treatment straight away. For those that do, there are two main treatment approaches:

* **Endovascular treatment**: A **minimally invasive** procedure performed from inside the blood vessels. A thin tube (catheter) is passed through an artery in the groin or wrist up to the brain. Devices such as coils, stents or flow diverters are placed to block or redirect blood flow away from the aneurysm.
* **Surgical clipping**: An **open operation**. A small section of the skull is temporarily removed, and a tiny metal clip is placed across the base (neck) of the aneurysm to seal it off. The bone is then replaced and fixed with plates.

Both treatments are effective. Historically, surgery was the only option. Today, most aneurysms suitable for endovascular treatment are treated that way because it is less invasive and recovery is often quicker.

## Hospital stay for unruptured aneurysms

Staying in hospital after aneurysm treatment allows doctors to monitor closely for complications such as stroke, seizures, or bleeding. It also gives time to manage pain effectively and care for the surgical or access site wound. The hospital stay supports early mobilisation and recovery in a safe environment, while also ensuring that plans for discharge and follow-up care are properly arranged.

For **endovascular treatment**, the average stay is about **one day**. Many patients go home the following morning, once routine scans and checks confirm that everything is stable. There may be some discomfort at the groin or wrist access site, but this usually settles quickly. Patients can mobilise soon after treatment and often return to normal activities within days. Returning to work is sometimes possible within the same week if recovery is smooth.

For **surgical clipping**, the hospital stay is usually **about a week**. This longer stay is because open surgery is more invasive, involves a wound in the skull, and requires closer monitoring as the body heals. Recovery takes longer. In the first days, swelling and bruising of the face are common and can temporarily close the eyes. Headaches are frequent. Some patients notice the **bone flap** (the piece of bone replaced after surgery) feels like it moves, but this is not dangerous and heals securely. The chewing muscle can be sore, making it harder to open the mouth or chew for a few months. These symptoms usually improve within six months.
Most people need a few weeks to months off work. Going back earlier is possible but can lead to more fatigue.

## What about ruptured aneurysms?

When an aneurysm **ruptures**, it causes a type of stroke called a **subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH)**. This is a life-threatening emergency. In this situation, hospital stays are much longer, usually at least **14 days**, and often longer if complications develop. Care almost always includes time in an **intensive care unit (ICU)**.

Treatment may be either endovascular or surgical, but the general trend is towards endovascular approaches when suitable, as supported by the **International Subarachnoid Aneurysm Trial (ISAT)**. This large study showed that, in patients with ruptured aneurysms suitable for either approach, endovascular treatment led to better outcomes and fewer long-term complications than open surgery.

## Key takeaways

* For **unruptured aneurysms**, hospital stay is about **1 day** after endovascular treatment and **about a week** after surgical clipping.
* **Endovascular treatment** is minimally invasive, usually with a **quicker recovery** and early return to normal activities.
* **Clipping** is more invasive, requiring a longer stay and a recovery that can take **weeks to months**.
* For **ruptured aneurysms** (subarachnoid haemorrhage), hospital stay is usually **at least 14 days**, often with time in **ICU**. * The **ISAT trial** showed that endovascular treatment gives better long-term outcomes than surgery for many ruptured aneurysms.

Brain aneurysms (otherwise known as cerebral or intracranial aneurysms) are treated to prevent them from bleeding, to stop a rebleed if one has already burst, or if they are enlarging and causing symptoms by pressing on the brain or nerves. Not every aneurysm needs an operation. Not all need treatment, with many best monitored with scans over time, alongside control of blood pressure, stopping smoking, and other lifestyle changes. Doctors use structured scoring systems such as **PHASES** (which predicts rupture risk) and **UIATS** (Unruptured Intracranial Aneurysm Treatment Score) to help decide whether treatment is necessary.

There are two main treatment options:

* **Surgical clipping**: An operation in which the skull is temporarily opened and a tiny metal clip is placed across the neck of the aneurysm to seal it off.
* **Endovascular treatment**: A minimally invasive approach performed from inside the blood vessels, usually by passing catheters from the groin or wrist up to the brain. Platinum coils, stents, or flow-diverting devices are placed to seal or redirect blood flow away from the aneurysm.

Historically, clipping was the only option. Since the early 2000s, large clinical studies such as the **International Subarachnoid Aneurysm Trial (ISAT)** have shown that endovascular coiling gives good outcomes for many patients. Today, most aneurysms that can be treated this way are managed endovascularly as it is a less invasive technique.

## Risks and recovery with surgical clipping

Surgical clipping is an established but more invasive method of treatment that still has a role in managing certain cerebral aneurysms. The procedure involves making an opening in the skull (a procedure called a craniotomy) to locate the aneurysm. With the help of a microscope, the surgeon places the clip on the aneurysm’s neck, sealing it off from the rest of the blood vessel.

Risks include:

* **Severe brain injury or death**: Rare, around 1%.
* **Stroke**: Occurs in about 5–15% of cases. This can cause weakness of the arms or legs, problems with speech, or vision changes.
* **Local effects**: The operation can affect the brain close to the aneurysm, leading to temporary swelling or bruising.
* **Epileptic seizures**: Rarely patients can develop epileptic seizures after surgery.
* **Infection**: The wound from the craniotomy (surgical opening in the skull) can very rarely become infected.

Recovery after clipping is usually longer than after endovascular treatment. Short-term discomfort is expected. Swelling and bruising of the face are common, sometimes causing the eyes to close for a few days. Headaches often occur. Some patients notice a feeling that the **bone flap** (the piece of bone removed during surgery and secured with plates) moves. This feels unusual but is not dangerous and heals over time. The chewing muscle may be affected, making it harder to open the mouth or chew for a few months. These symptoms usually improve within six months.

At home, recovery requires pacing. Patients are advised to rest regularly, stay hydrated, eat well, and build up light activity slowly. Many people need a few weeks or months off work. Returning sooner is possible but often increases fatigue.

## Risks and recovery with endovascular treatment

Rather than requiring an incision and direct surgical access to the aneurysm, endovascular treatment guides small, specialized devices through the patient’s blood vessels to the site of the aneurysm. Embolisation means to promote clot formation within the aneurysm by inserting devices such as coils into the aneurysm or placing stents acoss its neck.

* **Severe brain injury or death**: Again rare, around 1%.
* **Stroke**: Occurs in about 3–5% of cases.
* **Access site complications**: The site of entry into the blood vessels is usually the groin or wrist and some discomfort is common but usually temporary. It is possible to get bleeding after the procedure and obstruction of the blood vessel, which very rarely can require treatment such as further injections or surgery.

In contrast to surgery, epileptic seizures and wound infection are generally not a concern.

Advances in technology are reducing risks further. **Intrasaccular devices** such as the WEB, Neqstent, and Nautilus can treat wide-necked aneurysms. These devices have shown good success rates with low complication rates.

Recovery is usually fairly rapid. Many patients are up and about the same or next day. In elective (planned) cases, discharge the day after treatment is usual. Hospital stays and long-term side effects are less frequent than after surgical clipping.

## Why specialist centres matter

Both clipping and endovascular procedures should be performed in hospitals with experienced teams, usually neuroscience centres. Access to an intensive care or high-dependency unit is essential after either procedure. Outcomes are better in centres that perform higher volumes of these procedures, where interventional neuroradiologists (specialists in treating blood vessels from inside) and neurosurgeons work closely together.

## Key takeaways

* Many aneurysms are best monitored with imaging and risk-factor control.
* Two main treatments exist: **surgical clipping** (open operation) and **endovascular therapy** (minimally invasive).
* Historically clipping was the only option, but most aneurysms suitable for endovascular treatment are now treated this way.
* Clipping carries risks including **stroke** (5–15%), seizures, wound infection, and a small risk of **death** (\~1%).
* Endovascular treatment also has risks of stroke and death, in addition to access site complications, but often carries lower risks particularly for certain types of aneurysms and **quicker recovery**, with discharge the next day.
* Newer technology and techniques are making endovascular treatment even safer.
* These procedures are best performed in specialist centres with high volumes and access to **intensive care** support.



# Can you prevent brain aneurysms? {features}
---
description: Are brain aneuryms inevitable or you can reduce your chances?

## What causes aneurysms?

Unruptured intracranial aneurysms are found in about 3% of adults. Most aneurysms arise without a single identifiable cause. The vessel wall gradually weakens due to a mix of inherited and biological factors. Turbulent flow at arterial branch points and inflammation in the wall contribute to formation and growth.

At the same time, there are specific aneurysm types with clearer causes. For example, infectious aneurysms are due to infection of the vessel wall, dissecting aneurysms follow a tear in the inner lining, and traumatic pseudoaneurysms follow head injury.

## What raises risk?

**Non-modifiable factors.** Age, female sex after the menopause, and family history matter. Risk is higher if you have two or more first-degree relatives with aneurysm or aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage. Some conditions also raise risk, including autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, connective tissue disorders, and coarctation of the aorta.

**Modifiable factors.** Hypertension, smoking, heavy alcohol use, and stimulant drugs such as cocaine or amphetamines increase the chance of aneurysm formation and growth.

## What can you do to reduce risk?

* **Stop smoking.** This is one of the most effective steps to lower formation and growth risk.
* **Control blood pressure.** Aim for good day-to-day control with lifestyle and prescribed medication.
* **Moderate alcohol and avoid stimulants.** Cut excess alcohol and avoid cocaine and amphetamines.
* **General vascular health.** Keep active, manage weight, and control diabetes and lipids where relevant. This supports healthier vessel walls. (Mechanism described in the aneurysm wall section.)
* **Aspirin may be considered in selected cases.** Some centres consider low-dose aspirin to reduce wall inflammation and the chance of growth or rupture, but this should be a clinician-led decision after weighing bleeding risks.

## Should you be screened?

Population screening is not recommended because most aneurysms never rupture and screening does not prevent every bleed. Screening is usually offered if you have two or more first-degree relatives affected, or in certain conditions such as polycystic kidney disease or coarctation. If screening is needed, non-contrast time-of-flight MRA is preferred, typically starting around age 20 with repeat scans every 3 to 5 years until about 60 to 70, tailored to individual risk.

## If an aneurysm is found

Finding an aneurysm is not the same as needing an operation. Most never cause symptoms and most never bleed. The annual rupture risk for typical incidental aneurysms is well under 1 in 400. The majority of incidental aneurysms are safely observed with risk-factor control and periodic imaging. Growth risk can be estimated with tools such as ELAPSS, and rupture risk with PHASES, to guide follow up and treatment decisions in a multidisciplinary meeting.

If treatment is advised, there are two main options: **neurosurgical clipping** and **endovascular treatment** such as coiling or flow diversion. Both are effective.Endovascular treatment is minimally invasive and is often associated with shorter hospital stays and quicker recovery than open surgery.

Finally, remember that the absolute risk of rupture in the general population is low. The incidence of aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage is about 6 to 8 per 100,000 people per year. Focusing on blood pressure, smoking cessation and sensible screening where appropriate will do the most to reduce risk.

## Key takeaways

* Short answer: you cannot prevent every aneurysm, but you can lower your risk and catch higher risk problems early.
* Aneurysms are present in about 3% of adults. Most never rupture.
* Most aneurysms are idiopathic in practice, but some types have defined causes such as infection, dissection and trauma.
* Reduce risk by stopping smoking, controlling blood pressure, moderating alcohol, avoiding stimulants and maintaining overall vascular health. Consider aspirin only on clinician advice.
* Most incidental aneurysms do not need treatment. When treatment is needed, both clipping and endovascular options are effective. Endovascular treatment is minimally invasive and often means a quicker recovery.



# Who should be screened for brain aneurysms? {features}

## What is brain aneurysm screening?
A brain aneurysm is a weak spot in a blood vessel in the brain that can balloon out. Most never cause problems, but if an aneurysm bursts it can cause a serious type of stroke called a subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH).

Screening for aneurysms means using a special brain scan to look for them before they cause any symptoms. The aim is to find aneurysms in people at higher risk so doctors can advise on monitoring or treatment. Screening is not useful for everyone, but for certain groups it may help reduce the chance of a life-threatening bleed.

## Who is at higher risk and should be screened?
Doctors usually only recommend screening if you are in a group with a higher-than-average risk:

- **Family history:** If you have two or more close relatives (parents, brothers, sisters, or children) who have had a subarachnoid haemorrhage, your risk is much higher. Around 8–10% of people in this group will have an aneurysm when screened. The risk is especially high if you are a woman, a smoker, have high blood pressure, or if your affected relative is a brother or sister.

- **Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD):** This inherited kidney condition is linked with aneurysms. About 1 in 10 people with ADPKD will have an aneurysm, and the risk rises to 2 in 10 if there is also a family history of aneurysms or SAH.

- **Coarctation of the aorta:** This is a narrowing of the main artery leaving the heart. Around 1 in 10 people with this condition are found to have an aneurysm, probably related to high blood pressure or other unknown factors.

## Who does not need screening?
Screening is not advised for most people. The majority of aneurysms never rupture, and testing everyone could cause more harm than good. Discovering an aneurysm can cause anxiety, and treatment itself carries some risk.

Even for people who have already had an aneurysm rupture, the chance of developing a new one each year is very low (0.4–2.2%). In a major study (the ISAT trial), only 9 new ruptures occurred across more than 16,500 patient years of follow-up. Studies have shown that screening this group does not improve overall quality of life, and may even reduce it because of anxiety and potential complications from unnecessary treatment.

## How is screening done?
If you fall into a high-risk group, doctors will only arrange screening after a careful discussion of the pros and cons. Important points include:

- **When to start:** Screening is usually started around age 20. Aneurysms are very rare before this age.

- **How often to repeat:** If the first scan is clear, repeat screening is usually suggested every 3–5 years up to age 60–70. The decision depends on your medical history, family history and other risks. For example, if several relatives had an aneurysm rupture before age 40, doctors may stop screening you after age 50 because the main risk period has passed.

- **What scan is used:** The most common test is a 3D time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). This is a type of MRI scan that does not use radiation or injections. It is very good at detecting aneurysms larger than 2 mm, with a sensitivity of 87–100%.

- **Who reads the scans:** Because detecting aneurysms can be tricky, scans should ideally be reviewed by a neuroradiologist (a specialist in brain and blood vessel imaging).

## What is the goal of screening?
The main aim of screening is not just to find aneurysms, but to increase the number of healthy years of life. Screening is a balance: it can provide reassurance or identify aneurysms early, but it also carries the risk of worry and complications.

If you are in a higher-risk group, your doctor can talk through whether screening is right for you and help you make an informed choice.


## Key takeaways
- Screening is **not recommended for everyone**.
- It is usually offered to people with:
- Two or more close relatives who have had a subarachnoid haemorrhage
- Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD)
- Coarctation of the aorta
- Screening starts around age 20 and may be repeated every 3–5 years until about age 60–70.
- The test of choice is an MRI-based scan called **MRA**.
- The goal is to improve quality of life, not just to detect aneurysms.

## What is a brain aneurysm?
A brain aneurysm is a weak spot in a brain artery that can balloon out. Most never cause problems, but a rupture can lead to a serious bleed called a subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH).

## What are the warning signs of a bleed?
The classic warning sign is a sudden, very severe headache that reaches maximum intensity within minutes. Many people describe it as the “worst headache” they have ever had. Nausea or vomiting, neck stiffness, light sensitivity, fainting, seizures, or sudden problems with speech, sensation or movement can also occur.

## Can a thunderclap headache be benign?
Yes. About 40% of people with a thunderclap headache have a benign cause. Even so, SAH must be ruled out urgently because a rupture can be life-threatening.

## What symptoms can an unruptured aneurysm cause?
Most unruptured aneurysms cause no symptoms. If large or growing, they may press on nearby structures and cause pain behind the eye or double vision due to pressure on eye movement nerves.

## What should I do if I have these symptoms?
Call emergency services immediately if you develop a sudden, extremely severe headache or any of the symptoms above. Early assessment and treatment save lives.

---

## Key takeaways
- A sudden, worst-ever headache needs urgent medical assessment.
- Other warning signs include neck stiffness, vomiting, fainting, seizures and sudden weakness or speech problems.
- Most unruptured aneurysms are silent, but large ones can cause pain behind the eye or double vision.



# Living with an unruptured brain aneurysm {features}
---
description: Covers what it means to be diagnosed with a brain aneurysm, the risks involved, and what can patients can do to stay safe.
image: feature.jpg
tags: Aneurysm
---

## What does it mean to have an unruptured aneurysm?
Unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIA) are found in about 3% of adults, and most never cause symptoms. Small aneurysms under 7 mm are the ones most often detected incidentally.

## How likely is it to rupture?
For most people the annual risk is low, under 0.25% per year. Based on population figures, only one rupture occurs each year for every 300 to 500 people who have an aneurysm.

## How do doctors decide between monitoring and treatment?
Teams weigh aneurysm factors such as size, site, shape and growth, and personal factors such as age, blood pressure, smoking, other illnesses and family history. Tools like PHASES estimate rupture risk and ELAPSS estimates growth risk to support shared decisions.

## What does monitoring involve?
If monitoring is chosen, you will be advised to control vascular risk factors and have follow-up scans at 6–12 months, then annually or every two years, tailored to your risk of growth. Some units do not follow very small aneurysms under 4 mm in older adults, where the balance of benefit and risk is against intervention.

## What symptoms should I watch for?
Most UIAs are silent. Seek urgent help if you develop a sudden, severe headache that peaks within minutes, or new neurological symptoms such as weakness, speech or vision changes, or seizures.

## Can medicines help?
Your team will focus on blood pressure and other cardiovascular risks. Aspirin has been suggested in some studies to reduce aneurysm wall inflammation and the chances of growth or rupture, but this is individualised and should only be taken on specialist advice.

---

## Key takeaways
- Most unruptured aneurysms do not rupture, and many are safely monitored.
- Decisions balance aneurysm features and personal risk factors, often using PHASES and ELAPSS.
- Monitoring includes tight control of risk factors and planned imaging follow-up.
- Seek urgent care for a sudden, worst-ever headache or new neurological symptoms.


# Can lifestyle changes reduce the risk of a brain aneurysm? {features}
---
description: Describes the role of lifestyle in preventing aneurysms and bleeds.
image: feature_health.jpg
tags: Aneurysm
---

## Which risks can lifestyle influence?
Several acquired risk factors are linked with aneurysm formation and rupture, including high blood pressure, smoking, heavy alcohol use, and stimulant drugs such as cocaine and amphetamines.

## Do lifestyle changes make a difference to aneurysm bleeding rates?
Yes. In developed countries, SAH incidence has fallen over time, in part due to lower smoking rates and better control of vascular risk factors.

## What changes help most?
- Stop smoking and avoid exposure to tobacco.
- Keep blood pressure under control through diet, exercise and medicines if prescribed.
- Limit alcohol to low-risk levels and avoid binge drinking.
- Never use stimulant drugs such as cocaine or amphetamines.
- Maintain overall cardiovascular health, which supports brain vessel health.

## Are there medicines that reduce risk?
Some evidence suggests aspirin may reduce aneurysm wall inflammation and the risk of growth or rupture, but this is not a blanket recommendation. Only take it if your specialist advises it after weighing your personal risks and benefits.

## What about risks I cannot change?
Family history and certain genetic conditions such as autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease or connective tissue disorders increase risk. Your clinician may discuss targeted screening in these situations.

---

## Key takeaways
- Controlling blood pressure, stopping smoking, moderating alcohol and avoiding stimulant drugs reduce risk.
- Falling SAH rates are linked with better risk-factor control.
- Aspirin may help in selected cases, but only under specialist advice.
- Genetics and family history matter, and may guide screening, but lifestyle still counts.


# Should I have my aneurysm clipped or coiled? {features}
---
description: Understanding the differences between clipping and coiling for brain aneurysms and how to decide which treatment may be best for you.
image: feature_clipcoil.jpg
tags: Aneurysm
---

You may be in the situation where doctors have recommended treatment for a brain aneurysm but two options have been offered: clipping or coiling. This can be confusing especially since each treatment has different pros and cons. In order to make the decision, in the first instance, it is best to understand in detail the two treatments, as your own priorities may align more with one than the other.

## What is clipping?

Clipping is a form of **open surgery** that has been used since the 20th century. It involves a **craniotomy** (opening the skull) to locate the aneurysm. Using a microscope, the surgeon places a small clip across the aneurysm’s neck, sealing it off from the blood vessel.

## Can all aneurysms be treated with clipping?

Not quite all. Aneurysms in certain locations, especially in the **posterior circulation** (the arteries at the back of the brain), are usually not clipped because surgery there is too invasive and would cause excessive local damage.

## What are the benefits?

Clipping is an established therapy with an excellent chance of protecting the aneurysm. 

## What are the risks?

Risks include:

* **Stroke** in 5–15% of cases, which may cause weakness, speech or vision problems.
* Swelling around the brain at the site of the surgery can cause symptoms which are usually temporary. 
* About **1% risk of severe brain injury or death**.
* Rarely, **Seizures** (epilepsy) or **infection** of the bone flap site.
* **Temporary discomfort**: Swelling and bruising of the face, sometimes causing the eyes to close for a few days; headaches; a feeling that the **bone flap** (the piece of skull replaced after surgery) moves – this is not dangerous and heals over time; and difficulty chewing or opening the mouth due to muscle healing, which usually resolves within six months. 
* Recovery is usually longer than with endovascular treatment. On average patients are in hospital about a week after treatment of unruptured aneurysms, although times may be more or less in individual cases. 

## Can aneurysms recur after clipping?

Yes, although this is rare, however no treatment is 100% effective. In the ISAT trial, 6% of clipped aneurysms were incompletely occluded follow-up. If this occurs, further treatment may be needed.

## Can aneurysms bleed after clipping?

This is very rare but not impossible.

## Are aneurysms monitored after clipping?

In the UK, aneurysms are usually not monitored with scans after clipping unless there is a particular concern. 

## What is coiling?

Coiling is a form of **endovascular treatment** developed to overcome some of the shortcomings of surgery. It is not a temporary treatment, the intention is to provide life-long protection against aneurysm rupture. A thin catheter is passed from the groin or wrist into the brain’s blood vessels. Platinum coils are placed into the aneurysm, blocking blood flow. Coiling is often combined with other techniques such as **stents**, **flow diverters**, or **intrasaccular devices** to make treatment safer and more effective.

## Can all aneurysms be treated with coiling?

Almost all aneurysms can now be treated endovascularly, with rare exceptions. 

## What are the risks?

Risks include:

* **Stroke** in around 3–5% of cases due to rupture or blockage, though usually lower than for surgery
* About **1% risk of severe brain injury or death**
* Rarely, vessel damage at the groin or wrist requiring surgery
* Temporary sypmtoms such as: Mild soreness, or oozing at the groin or wrist access site
 headaches or pain in the groin. 
* In some cases, **antiplatelet medication** (such as low-dose aspirin) is prescribed for several months if a stent is used. This can cause bruising if you knock yourself. 
* Recovery is usually rapid. Patients typically spend one night in hospital and go home the next day. 

## Will I need to take life-long blood-thinning medication?

Antiplatelet (blood thinning) medication is sometimes, but not always, prescribed. This usually takes the form of two tablets, low-dose aspirin and a second tablet such as prasugrel (Plavix), clopidogrel, or ticagrelor (Brillanta). The second tablet is usually discontinued at 6-months. The low-dose aspirin is usually continued 1–2 years and then usually stopped, although rarely it is continued long-term. 

## Can aneurysms recur after coiling?

Yes, though this is also uncommon. In the **ISAT trial**, 8% of coiled aneurysms were incompletely occluded at follow-up. If this happens, it is usually seen on scans and further endovascular treatment can be performed.

## Can aneurysms bleed after coiling?

As with clipping, this is extremely rare but not impossible.

## Are aneurysms monitored after coiling?

Yes. Typically follow-up scans are performed with **MRA** (magnetic resonance angiography, no radiation) or sometimes **CTA** or **DSA** (digital subtraction angiography). These are usually done for a few years and then stopped if the aneurysm is stable.

## So should I have it clipped or coiled?

This is a **personal decision** and the final choice depends on your own preferences and circumstances.

It is important to consider both the risk of the aneurysm and the risks of treatment. Both are very effective treatments with comparable long-term rates of aneurysm protection.

* **Clipping** has a slightly higher rate of complete occlusion, meaning retreatment is less often needed. However, it is a more invasive procedure that carries higher risks of stroke (5–15%), seizures, and wound complications, and requires a longer recovery.
* **Coiling and endovascular treatment** also has a very high occlusion rate, though in a small number of patients follow-up treatment is required. It carries a lower stroke risk, is much less invasive, usually involves just one night in hospital, and allows much quicker recovery.



## Key takeaways

* **Clipping**: open surgery, highly effective, but higher risk of **stroke**, **seizures**, and longer recovery.
* **Coiling**: minimally invasive, lower risk of stroke, usually just **1 day in hospital**, but sometimes needs **follow-up treatment**.
* Both treatments are **very effective**, and the risk of bleeding afterwards is **extremely low**.
* Choice depends on aneurysm features, medical advice, and your own **preferences**.

## What are the main treatment paths?
Treatment aims to secure the aneurysm and prevent bleeding or rebleeding. Options include endovascular procedures inside the vessel, or open surgery. Decisions depend on aneurysm features and your overall health, and are best made by a multidisciplinary team.

## What is endovascular coiling?
A thin tube is guided into the aneurysm and soft platinum coils are packed inside to block blood flow and encourage healing of the vessel wall. Coiling is the usual first-line option when the anatomy allows.

## What is neurosurgical clipping?
A surgeon opens the skull and places a tiny clip across the neck of the aneurysm to stop blood entering it. Clipping is used when coiling is not suitable, for example in some anatomical patterns or when a blood clot must be removed at the same time.

## What newer devices might be used?
Specialist centres may use stents to support coils in wide-necked aneurysms, flow-diverting stents to redirect blood along the artery, or intrasaccular devices placed directly in the aneurysm sac.
In the acute phase after a bleed, stent-assisted coiling and flow diversion need dual antiplatelet medicines and carry higher risk, so they are reserved for select situations.

## How do doctors decide the best approach?
For a ruptured aneurysm, national guidance advises an interventional neuroradiologist and a neurosurgeon to agree a plan with you, choosing between coiling, clipping, or careful monitoring if neither is appropriate.
If there has been a bleed, securing the aneurysm should happen as early as possible, ideally within 24 hours, to reduce the risk of rebleeding.

## What does the evidence say about outcomes after a bleed?
In the ISAT trial, patients suitable for either treatment had lower death and dependency at one year with coiling than with clipping. Advantages for coiling persisted at 10 and 18 years.

## How are unruptured aneurysms managed?
Most do not rupture. Choices depend on aneurysm size, site and shape, your age and health, and whether the aneurysm is growing. Teams often use tools such as PHASES and ELAPSS to support decision-making, and may recommend monitoring rather than treatment in many cases.
Monitoring typically includes strict control of vascular risk factors and interval imaging at 6–12 months, then yearly or every two years, tailored to growth risk.

## Key takeaways
- Coiling is usually first-line when suitable. Clipping is used when anatomy or circumstances make it a better choice.
- After a bleed, early treatment reduces rebleeding risk.
- Newer options include stents, flow diverters and intrasaccular devices, used selectively.
- Many unruptured aneurysms are monitored rather than treated, using structured risk tools and planned imaging.
