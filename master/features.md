## What is brain aneurysm screening?
A brain aneurysm is a weak spot in a blood vessel in the brain that can balloon out. Most never cause problems, but if an aneurysm bursts it can cause a serious type of stroke called a subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH).  

Screening for aneurysms means using a special brain scan to look for them before they cause any symptoms. The aim is to find aneurysms in people at higher risk so doctors can advise on monitoring or treatment. Screening is not useful for everyone, but for certain groups it may help reduce the chance of a life-threatening bleed.

## Who is at higher risk and should be screened?
Doctors usually only recommend screening if you are in a group with a higher-than-average risk:  

- **Family history:** If you have two or more close relatives (parents, brothers, sisters, or children) who have had a subarachnoid haemorrhage, your risk is much higher. Around 8–10% of people in this group will have an aneurysm when screened. The risk is especially high if you are a woman, a smoker, have high blood pressure, or if your affected relative is a brother or sister.  

- **Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD):** This inherited kidney condition is linked with aneurysms. About 1 in 10 people with ADPKD will have an aneurysm, and the risk rises to 2 in 10 if there is also a family history of aneurysms or SAH.  

- **Coarctation of the aorta:** This is a narrowing of the main artery leaving the heart. Around 1 in 10 people with this condition are found to have an aneurysm, probably related to high blood pressure or other unknown factors.  

## Who does not need screening?
Screening is not advised for most people. The majority of aneurysms never rupture, and testing everyone could cause more harm than good. Discovering an aneurysm can cause anxiety, and treatment itself carries some risk.  

Even for people who have already had an aneurysm rupture, the chance of developing a new one each year is very low (0.4–2.2%). In a major study (the ISAT trial), only 9 new ruptures occurred across more than 16,500 patient years of follow-up. Studies have shown that screening this group does not improve overall quality of life, and may even reduce it because of anxiety and potential complications from unnecessary treatment.  

## How is screening done?
If you fall into a high-risk group, doctors will only arrange screening after a careful discussion of the pros and cons. Important points include:  

- **When to start:** Screening is usually started around age 20. Aneurysms are very rare before this age.  

- **How often to repeat:** If the first scan is clear, repeat screening is usually suggested every 3–5 years up to age 60–70. The decision depends on your medical history, family history and other risks. For example, if several relatives had an aneurysm rupture before age 40, doctors may stop screening you after age 50 because the main risk period has passed.  

- **What scan is used:** The most common test is a 3D time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). This is a type of MRI scan that does not use radiation or injections. It is very good at detecting aneurysms larger than 2 mm, with a sensitivity of 87–100%.  

- **Who reads the scans:** Because detecting aneurysms can be tricky, scans should ideally be reviewed by a neuroradiologist (a specialist in brain and blood vessel imaging).  

## What is the goal of screening?
The main aim of screening is not just to find aneurysms, but to increase the number of healthy years of life. Screening is a balance: it can provide reassurance or identify aneurysms early, but it also carries the risk of worry and complications.  

If you are in a higher-risk group, your doctor can talk through whether screening is right for you and help you make an informed choice.  


## Key takeaways
- Screening is **not recommended for everyone**.  
- It is usually offered to people with:  
  - Two or more close relatives who have had a subarachnoid haemorrhage  
  - Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD)  
  - Coarctation of the aorta  
- Screening starts around age 20 and may be repeated every 3–5 years until about age 60–70.  
- The test of choice is an MRI-based scan called **MRA**.  
- The goal is to improve quality of life, not just to detect aneurysms.

## What is a brain aneurysm?
A brain aneurysm is a weak spot in a brain artery that can balloon out. Most never cause problems, but a rupture can lead to a serious bleed called a subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH). 

## What are the warning signs of a bleed?
The classic warning sign is a sudden, very severe headache that reaches maximum intensity within minutes. Many people describe it as the “worst headache” they have ever had. Nausea or vomiting, neck stiffness, light sensitivity, fainting, seizures, or sudden problems with speech, sensation or movement can also occur. 

## Can a thunderclap headache be benign?
Yes. About 40% of people with a thunderclap headache have a benign cause. Even so, SAH must be ruled out urgently because a rupture can be life-threatening. 

## What symptoms can an unruptured aneurysm cause?
Most unruptured aneurysms cause no symptoms. If large or growing, they may press on nearby structures and cause pain behind the eye or double vision due to pressure on eye movement nerves. 

## What should I do if I have these symptoms?
Call emergency services immediately if you develop a sudden, extremely severe headache or any of the symptoms above. Early assessment and treatment save lives.

---

## Key takeaways
- A sudden, worst-ever headache needs urgent medical assessment.   
- Other warning signs include neck stiffness, vomiting, fainting, seizures and sudden weakness or speech problems.   
- Most unruptured aneurysms are silent, but large ones can cause pain behind the eye or double vision.

## What does it mean to have an unruptured aneurysm?
Unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIA) are found in about 3% of adults, and most never cause symptoms. Small aneurysms under 7 mm are the ones most often detected incidentally. 

## How likely is it to rupture?
For most people the annual risk is low, under 0.25% per year. Based on population figures, only one rupture occurs each year for every 300 to 500 people who have an aneurysm. 

## How do doctors decide between monitoring and treatment?
Teams weigh aneurysm factors such as size, site, shape and growth, and personal factors such as age, blood pressure, smoking, other illnesses and family history. Tools like PHASES estimate rupture risk and ELAPSS estimates growth risk to support shared decisions. 

## What does monitoring involve?
If monitoring is chosen, you will be advised to control vascular risk factors and have follow-up scans at 6–12 months, then annually or every two years, tailored to your risk of growth. Some units do not follow very small aneurysms under 4 mm in older adults, where the balance of benefit and risk is against intervention. 

## What symptoms should I watch for?
Most UIAs are silent. Seek urgent help if you develop a sudden, severe headache that peaks within minutes, or new neurological symptoms such as weakness, speech or vision changes, or seizures. 

## Can medicines help?
Your team will focus on blood pressure and other cardiovascular risks. Aspirin has been suggested in some studies to reduce aneurysm wall inflammation and the chances of growth or rupture, but this is individualised and should only be taken on specialist advice. 

---

## Key takeaways
- Most unruptured aneurysms do not rupture, and many are safely monitored.   
- Decisions balance aneurysm features and personal risk factors, often using PHASES and ELAPSS.   
- Monitoring includes tight control of risk factors and planned imaging follow-up.   
- Seek urgent care for a sudden, worst-ever headache or new neurological symptoms.

---

## Which risks can lifestyle influence?
Several acquired risk factors are linked with aneurysm formation and rupture, including high blood pressure, smoking, heavy alcohol use, and stimulant drugs such as cocaine and amphetamines. 

## Do lifestyle changes make a difference to aneurysm bleeding rates?
Yes. In developed countries, SAH incidence has fallen over time, in part due to lower smoking rates and better control of vascular risk factors. 

## What changes help most?
- Stop smoking and avoid exposure to tobacco.   
- Keep blood pressure under control through diet, exercise and medicines if prescribed.   
- Limit alcohol to low-risk levels and avoid binge drinking.   
- Never use stimulant drugs such as cocaine or amphetamines.   
- Maintain overall cardiovascular health, which supports brain vessel health. 

## Are there medicines that reduce risk?
Some evidence suggests aspirin may reduce aneurysm wall inflammation and the risk of growth or rupture, but this is not a blanket recommendation. Only take it if your specialist advises it after weighing your personal risks and benefits. 

## What about risks I cannot change?
Family history and certain genetic conditions such as autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease or connective tissue disorders increase risk. Your clinician may discuss targeted screening in these situations. 

---

## Key takeaways
- Controlling blood pressure, stopping smoking, moderating alcohol and avoiding stimulant drugs reduce risk.   
- Falling SAH rates are linked with better risk-factor control.   
- Aspirin may help in selected cases, but only under specialist advice.   
- Genetics and family history matter, and may guide screening, but lifestyle still counts.

## What are the main treatment paths?
Treatment aims to secure the aneurysm and prevent bleeding or rebleeding. Options include endovascular procedures inside the vessel, or open surgery. Decisions depend on aneurysm features and your overall health, and are best made by a multidisciplinary team. 

## What is endovascular coiling?
A thin tube is guided into the aneurysm and soft platinum coils are packed inside to block blood flow and encourage healing of the vessel wall. Coiling is the usual first-line option when the anatomy allows. 

## What is neurosurgical clipping?
A surgeon opens the skull and places a tiny clip across the neck of the aneurysm to stop blood entering it. Clipping is used when coiling is not suitable, for example in some anatomical patterns or when a blood clot must be removed at the same time. 

## What newer devices might be used?
Specialist centres may use stents to support coils in wide-necked aneurysms, flow-diverting stents to redirect blood along the artery, or intrasaccular devices placed directly in the aneurysm sac.   
In the acute phase after a bleed, stent-assisted coiling and flow diversion need dual antiplatelet medicines and carry higher risk, so they are reserved for select situations. 

## How do doctors decide the best approach?
For a ruptured aneurysm, national guidance advises an interventional neuroradiologist and a neurosurgeon to agree a plan with you, choosing between coiling, clipping, or careful monitoring if neither is appropriate.   
If there has been a bleed, securing the aneurysm should happen as early as possible, ideally within 24 hours, to reduce the risk of rebleeding. 

## What does the evidence say about outcomes after a bleed?
In the ISAT trial, patients suitable for either treatment had lower death and dependency at one year with coiling than with clipping. Advantages for coiling persisted at 10 and 18 years. 

## How are unruptured aneurysms managed?
Most do not rupture. Choices depend on aneurysm size, site and shape, your age and health, and whether the aneurysm is growing. Teams often use tools such as PHASES and ELAPSS to support decision-making, and may recommend monitoring rather than treatment in many cases.   
Monitoring typically includes strict control of vascular risk factors and interval imaging at 6–12 months, then yearly or every two years, tailored to growth risk. 

---

## Key takeaways
- Coiling is usually first-line when suitable. Clipping is used when anatomy or circumstances make it a better choice.   
- After a bleed, early treatment reduces rebleeding risk.   
- Newer options include stents, flow diverters and intrasaccular devices, used selectively.   
- Many unruptured aneurysms are monitored rather than treated, using structured risk tools and planned imaging.
