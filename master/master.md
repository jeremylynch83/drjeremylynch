A brain arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is a complex, abnormal network of blood vessels in the brain. In a healthy brain, blood circulates from arteries to veins via tiny vessels called capillaries. The capillaries allow for the exchange of oxygen and nutrients from the blood to the brain tissue, and the removal of waste products. However, in a brain AVM, there is a direct connections between the arteries and veins, bypassing these capillaries.

![Arteriovenous malformations.](img/avm.svg)

Whilst AVMs may lead to health problems, many do not cause any problems and can be left alone without treatment.

The most frequent problems are headaches and seizures. Headaches can vary in intensity and frequency, potentially mimicking migraines in some instances. Seizures may manifest in various ways, ranging from changes in a person's behavior or consciousness to involuntary movements or loss of control over movement.

In serious cases, the abnormal blood vessels in an AVM may rupture, causing bleeding within the brain (intracranial haemorrhage). Bleeding from a ruptured AVM can cause a sudden, severe headache, nausea, vomiting, incontinence, blurred vision, and even loss of consciousness. Depending on the location of the bleed, impairments caused by local brain tissue damage are also possible, including seizure, weakness on one side of the body (hemiparesis), a loss of touch sensation on one side of the body, and deficits in language processing (aphasia).

## Cause

The exact cause of brain AVMs is not fully understood, but they are most commonly believed to originate before birth. They may grow over time or remain static in size.

## Epidemiology

Brain AVMs are  rare, with an estimated annual detection rate of around 1 per 100,000 people. The prevalence in adults is approximately 18 per 100,000.

They seem to occur more often in males than females. However, symptoms may start or worsen in females during pregnancy due to the increased blood flow and volume. There is also a significant occurrence (15 to 20%) of AVMs in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, also known as Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome, which is a genetic disorder that leads to abnormal blood vessel formation.




## Prognosis

The main risk associated with brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) is intracranial haemorrhage, which is bleeding inside the skull. This risk varies among patients and is difficult to measure because many patients with AVMs don't show symptoms and therefore never seek medical attention.

The earlier in life an AVM appears, the greater the likelihood of experiencing a haemorrhage over one's lifetime. Ruptured AVMs can lead to serious health complications. Ruptures may cause loss of life or permanent disability.

AVMs often do not cause any clinical problems until they rupture. AVMs can cause symptoms either by bleeding (rupturing), pressing on the brain or spinal cord, or by reducing the amount of oxygen reaching the brain tissue.

Symptoms might include the following:

## Headaches

Some people with AVMs experience headaches, while others never do. When headaches occur, they are often similar to migraines and can sometimes happen at the back of the head. Having headaches does not mean that the AVM is more likely to bleed. The risk of bleeding depends mainly on features seen on brain scans, not on whether headaches are present.

Treatment for an AVM is usually focused on reducing the risk of bleeding. If headaches remain the main issue, they are often treated in the same way as other types of headache, with medicines and lifestyle measures tailored to the individual.

## Bleeding

Brain AVMs may cause bleeding into the brain (haemorrhage), causing sudden, severe headaches, confusion, nausea, vomiting, and may lead to a loss of consciousness.

## Seizures

Seizures are bursts of abnormal brain activity that can affect behaviour, movement, sensation, and awareness, ranging from brief staring to severe convulsions.

Focal seizures begin in one area of the brain and may or may not impair awareness, sometimes progressing to convulsions. Generalised seizures involve the whole brain, causing loss of consciousness, spasms, or convulsions, and include absence, tonic-clonic, atonic, and myoclonic types.

Convulsions are uncontrolled movements, often with stiffening, jerking, and loss of consciousness. In AVMs, seizures arise when the malformation disrupts normal electrical activity.

## Neurological Symptoms

 These depend on the location of the AVM and can include muscle weakness or paralysis in one part of the body, a loss of coordination (ataxia) that can lead to such problems as gait disturbances, difficulties carrying out tasks that require planning, memory deficits, dizziness, visual disturbances such as a loss of part of the visual field, difficulties with speech (dysarthria), and abnormal sensations such as numbness, tingling, or spontaneous pain (paresthesia or dysesthesia).

sameAs: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arteriovenous_malformation#Diagnosis"
---


There are three primary imaging techniques used in the diagnosis and investigation of brain AVMs: computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and cerebral angiography.

**Computed Tomography (CT)**

A CT scan is usually the initial imaging study performed when a patient is symptomatic. A CT scan is a type of X-ray that produces detailed cross-sectional images of the brain. It can suggest the approximate site of a bleed if one has occurred.

For a more detailed view, a computerized tomography angiogram (CTA) may be performed. In a CTA, a contrast agent (a type of dye) is injected into the patient's bloodstream. The contrast agent helps to illuminate the blood vessels on the CT scan, providing a more detailed view of the AVM's structure.

**Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)**

MRI is more sensitive than CT in diagnosing AVMs and provides better information about the exact location of the malformation (@fig:mri_avm). MRI uses a powerful magnetic field and radio waves to create detailed images of the brain and other structures. An MRI can provide a clear, detailed view of the brain's soft tissues, making it particularly useful in imaging AVMs. For even more detailed imaging, a magnetic resonance angiogram (MRA) can be performed, similar to a CTA, a contrast agent is injected into the bloodstream to highlight the blood vessels.

![MRI of an AVM. ](img/mri_avm-360.webp){#fig:mri_avm}

**Cerebral Angiography**

Cerebral angiography, sometimes also called a cerebral arteriogram, provides the most detailed images of a cerebral AVM (@fig:avm_angio). This procedure involves threading a catheter (a thin, flexible tube) through an artery in the arm or leg up to the arteries in the head. A contrast agent is then injected through the catheter. As the contrast agent flows through the blood vessels of the brain, a sequence of X-ray images are taken. These images can provide a highly detailed view of the AVM, showing the exact location, size, and the blood flow pattern.

---


The treatment of brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) depends on several factors, including the AVM's location and size, and whether it has caused bleeding.

**Medical Treatment**

Anticonvulsant medications, such as phenytoin, are used to control seizures. Other medications or procedures can be employed to relieve pressure inside the skull caused by the AVM. Curative treatment may eventually be required to prevent haemorrhage. However, all interventions carry some risk of causing neurological deficits.

**Endovascular Treatment**

Embolisation is a treatment approach performed by specialists known as interventional neuroradiologists. This procedure involves injecting substances into the blood vessels feeding the AVM to block them, reducing blood flow to the AVM. These substances are delivered via a catheter guided by real-time imaging. Benefits include the minimally invasive nature of the treatment and the immediate effect compared with radiosurgery. Endovascular therapy can also access areas of the brain that would be high-risk surgically. The cure rate depends on the type of AVM, however, and not all AVMs are treated endovascularly as first-line therapy. Embolisation may also be used as an additional treatment before surgery or radiosurgery to reduce AVM size.

**Surgical Treatment**

Surgical removal of the involved blood vessels is a good option for many types of AVMs. In this procedure, a neurosurgeon temporarily removes part of the skull (craniotomy), separates the AVM from the surrounding brain tissue, and removes (resects) the abnormal vessels. This method can result in immediate, complete removal of the AVM, but the risks depend on the size and location of the malformation. Not all AVMs are suitable for surgical treatment, and the decision depends on several factors, including the AVM's size, location, and the patient's overall health.

**Radiosurgical Treatment**

Radiosurgery, such as Gamma Knife therapy, can successfully treat small and medium-sized AVMs. This method precisely delivers controlled doses of radiation to the AVM area in the brain. While radiosurgery does not require an incision or craniotomy, it may take three or more years to fully assess the treatment's effects, during which time there is still a risk of bleeding. Some patients may need repeat treatments. Radiosurgery can also carry risks such as headache, seizures, or permanent neurological deficits.

## What is a dural arteriovenous fistula?

A dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVF) is an abnormal connection between the arteries and veins of the brain.

Normally a fine network of microscopic capillaries connects arteries and veins in all tissues including the brain (@fig:davf_diagram). Capillaries assist in slowing down the blood flow between arteries and veins. A DAVF is a tangle of feeding arteries and draining veins in the brain that have abnormal connections which bypass the normal capillaries. The word “dura” refers to the membrane covering the brain and spinal cord. The high pressure blood flowing from arteries directly into thinner walled draining veins or venous sinuses results in a risk of brain haemorrhage (bleeding). This abnormal blood flow between arteries and veins is called a shunt. DAVF can vary in size, between a few millimetres to several centimetres and can occur anywhere in the dura directly outside of the brain or spinal cord.

![Dural fistulas. ](img/davf.svg){#fig:davf_diagram}


The exact cause of a dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVF) is often unknown. In most cases, DAVFs are not inherited but are thought to develop after events such as blood clots in the brain’s large draining veins (venous thrombosis), head injury, brain surgery, or infection.

DAVFs are classified by risk. High-grade fistulas carry a significant chance of bleeding into or around the brain, especially if bleeding has occurred before, and this can have serious consequences. Low-grade fistulas have little or no risk of bleeding.

Some patients have no symptoms, and the DAVF may be found incidentally on a CT or MRI scan. However, even when discovered by chance, further investigation is usually needed to assess potential risk.

A dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVF) creates an abnormal connection between high-pressure arteries and low-pressure veins, bypassing the normal capillary network. This abnormal shunting of blood can cause a number of problems. The entry of arterial blood into the venous system raises venous pressure, and since veins are not designed to handle such force, they may stretch, dilate or even rupture, which can lead to bleeding in or around the brain.

In some cases, blood flows backwards within the veins, a process known as venous reflux. This congestion reduces normal blood flow in parts of the brain or spinal cord, which over time can injure tissue and produce symptoms such as weakness, numbness or seizures. A DAVF may also divert blood away from healthy brain or spinal tissue, depriving it of oxygen and nutrients and thereby causing further neurological problems such as early dementia.

The exact effects depend on the location of the fistula. For example, when a DAVF occurs near the ear, patients may develop pulsatile tinnitus, a rhythmic whooshing sound that follows the heartbeat.

Not everyone with a DAVF develops symptoms. When symptoms do occur, they can vary widely depending on the location of the DAVF and the way it affects blood flow. Some people develop symptoms gradually, while others may notice them suddenly.

## Neurological Symptoms

**Headaches** – New or persistent headaches, often different in pattern or severity from previous ones.

**Visual disturbances** – Blurred vision, double vision, or partial loss of sight.

**Balance and coordination problems** – Difficulty walking or clumsiness.

**Weakness or numbness** – Often affecting one side of the body.

**Cognitive decline** – Gradual problems with memory, thinking or behaviour that can resemble dementia.

## Auditory Symptoms

**Pulsatile tinnitus** – A rhythmic whooshing or ringing sound in the ear, in sync with the heartbeat.

## Severe Symptoms (Emergency)

**Bleeding in or around the brain (intracranial haemorrhage)** – May present with sudden severe headache (“worst ever”), vomiting, loss of consciousness, or neurological deficits such as weakness or difficulty speaking.

**Seizures** – Sudden, uncontrolled electrical activity in the brain. This may cause collapse, loss of consciousness and convulsions.

**Stroke-like symptoms** – Sudden weakness on one side, facial drooping or difficulty speaking.

Diagnosing a dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVF) is a step-by-step process that involves various tests and examinations. The goal is not only to confirm the presence of a DAVF, but also to understand its risk, size, location, and the precise pattern of abnormal blood flow. This helps us formulate a suitable treatment plan.

## Medical History and Physical Examination

The first step involves a thorough review of your medical history. We will ask you detailed questions about your symptoms, including their nature, duration, and severity. We may also ask you about your overall health, including any other medical conditions you may have and any medications you are currently taking.


## Imaging Tests

Several types of imaging tests can help visualize the blood vessels in the brain and detect any abnormalities. These include:

- **Computed Tomography (CT):** A CT scan uses X-ray technology to capture images from various angles, creating cross-sectional views of the brain. These can reveal abnormalities or changes in the brain that might be indicative of a DAVF. Additionally, a CT scan can be combined with angiography (CTA) to provide detailed images of the blood vessels, enhancing the visualization of a possible DAVF.

- **Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI):** An MRI is a non-invasive imaging technique that employs powerful magnets and radio waves to generate comprehensive images of the brain and spinal cord. These images can often highlight the presence of a DAVF or illustrate the impact it has on the brain or spinal cord. MRI can also be combined with angiography (MRA) to visualize blood vessels and the flow of blood, offering a detailed view of any abnormal vascular structures associated with DAVF.

- **Digital Subtraction Angiogram (DSA):** DSA is a more invasive procedure that is often used when other imaging tests are inconclusive or when precise details of the blood vessels are needed for treatment planning. In this test, a contrast dye is injected into your blood vessels through a catheter, usually inserted in your groin. As the dye travels through your vessels, a series of X-ray images are taken, which can provide a clear, detailed view of the blood flow and reveal the exact location and characteristics of a DAVF. While more involved and with more potential risks than other imaging studies, DSA is considered the "gold standard" for diagnosing DAVFs due to its high level of detail.

The goals of treating a dural arteriovenous fistula are twofold: to relieve symptoms and to reduce the risk of serious bleeding around the brain in the future. The mainstay of treatment is endovascular therapy, in which a catheter is guided through the blood vessels to the site of the fistula. Special materials such as coils, glue or other embolic agents are then used to block the abnormal connection between arteries and veins, restoring more normal blood flow.



## How can endovascular treatment help?

“Endovascular” means that access to the brain or surroundings is achieved by threading a very fine tube through your arteries. Embolisation is a way of blocking abnormal blood vessels and is usually carried out to prevent the DAVF from bleeding. This is done by injecting a special glue-like liquid into the DAVF to cut off the blood vessels supplying the fistula.


## What happens during the embolisation procedure?

Dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVF) embolisation is carried out under general anaesthesia in the angiography suite and typically takes between one and three hours. A multidisciplinary team of radiologists, radiographers, anaesthetists and nurses monitors the patient closely throughout.

The procedure begins with the insertion of a thin, flexible plastic tube (catheter) into either the femoral artery in the groin or an artery in the wrist. The catheter is advanced through the aorta into the cerebral arteries of the neck and brain. Once the most accessible feeding vessel is identified, additional catheters, including a microcatheter, are introduced to reach the point of the fistulous connection (@fig:davf_embo). Embolic material, often glue-like in consistency, is then injected to occlude the DAVF. In some cases, small platinum coils are deployed in addition. The embolic material forms an artificial clot, preventing further abnormal blood flow into the fistula. X-rays are obtained throughout to confirm successful obliteration.

At the end of the procedure, the catheters are removed and the puncture site in the groin or wrist is sealed with a collagen plug or controlled manually to prevent bleeding. The procedure usually takes 2–3 hours.

![Dural fistula embolisation. (A) A DAVF is seen towards the top of the head. (B) Coils are placed, blocking the blood flow. (C) The fistula is gone at the end of the procedure. ](img/davf_embo.webp){#fig:davf_embo}


## Will it hurt?

The procedure is performed under general anaesthesia, so no pain is experienced during the intervention. Some discomfort may occur afterwards at the wrist or groin access site, but this is usually mild and resolves with simple analgesics.


## What are the risks of DAVF embolisation?

All medical procedures carry risks, and for dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVF) embolisation these depend on the size, position and configuration of the vessels.

1. **Contrast dye risks** – The iodine-based dye used to show the blood vessels on X-ray can occasionally cause an allergic reaction (ranging from mild rash to severe reaction needing urgent treatment) and can sometimes affect kidney function, especially in people with pre-existing kidney problems. A blood test may be done beforehand to check kidney function.

2. **Risks of the general anaesthetic** – As with any general anaesthetic, there are some risks such as sickness or sore throat, and very rarely more serious complications.

3. **Stroke** – The main risk of the procedure is stroke, which occurs in about 5 in every 100 people. A stroke can cause weakness, problems with speech, or changes in vision. These effects can sometimes be temporary but may also be permanent.

4. **Severe brain injury or death** – There is a very rare risk of a severe brain injury that can result in death, estimated at about 1 in every 100 patients.

5. **Radiation exposure** – The X-rays used carry a very small long-term risk of developing cancer, and very occasionally can cause temporary hair loss or skin redness around the treated area.

6. **Bruising at the access site** – The procedure is usually done through a small tube in the wrist or groin. Bruising in this area is common and generally minor, though rarely the bruise can become large and may need further treatment, including surgery.


## Are there any alternatives?

Surgical excision is an alternative treatment in which a craniotomy (skull incision) is performed to directly access the DAVF. The feeding arteries and draining veins are then clipped and disconnected. This is a well-established but more invasive treatment that can provide lasting protection against rupture or haemorrhage. Surgical excision also carries its own specific risks.

## What happens after the embolisation?

On arrival to the ward, a period of bed rest is required for recovery. During this time, the nursing staff carry out regular checks, including inspection of the catheter entry site in the groin to ensure there is no bleeding. If bleeding occurs, the period of rest is extended. Some bruising and soreness around the groin is common, but most patients experience little or no after effects. Most commonly patients go home the day after treatment.

Spinal vascular malformations are uncommon conditions that involve abnormal connections between blood vessels in your spinal cord. They are essential to recognize because, if left undiagnosed and untreated, they can lead to serious complications. Symptoms can vary from person to person and can include pain, numbness, weakness, or difficulty moving your limbs. Bladder and bowel function can be impaired. The process of diagnosing these conditions is frequently prolonged due to the gradual onset of symptoms and limited awareness of the disease among non-expert practitioners. Radiological investigation can also be challenging as these conditions can resemble other non-vascular processes.

There are a number of different types.


## Arteriovenous Fistulae

Arteriovenous fistulae form when there is a direct connection between an artery and a vein, bypassing the capillaries. This abnormal shunting of blood can put additional pressure on your heart and blood vessels and can deprive tissues of the necessary oxygen and nutrients, leading to various symptoms such as pain or numbness.


## Arteriovenous Malformations (AVMs)

AVMs are a tangled web of arteries and veins with no capillaries in between. These abnormalities can disrupt normal blood flow and oxygen circulation, causing nearby tissues to suffer. Over time, these vessels can enlarge and rupture, leading to bleeding into the spinal cord. This can cause sudden pain and other neurological issues.


## Cavernous Malformations

Cavernous malformations, also known as cavernomas, are clusters of abnormal, tiny blood vessels and larger, dilated vessels filled with slow-moving blood. They can form anywhere in the body, but when they occur in the spinal cord, they can compress neural structures leading to pain, numbness, or weakness in your limbs.

## Capillary Telangiectasia

Capillary telangiectasia involves clusters of widened capillaries that do not have a normal vessel wall. While they are typically the least symptomatic of spinal vascular malformations, they can occasionally put pressure on the spinal cord, causing symptoms such as difficulty walking or loss of bowel or bladder control.

The symptoms of spinal vascular malformations can widely vary from person to person. They are largely dependent on the location and severity of the malformation. Some individuals may not experience noticeable symptoms for many years, or even at all, while others may endure symptoms that severely disrupt daily activities or present life-threatening risks.

These conditions typically present symptoms during early adulthood, but it's worth noting that a significant percentage of those diagnosed are under the age of 16.

The onset of symptoms can either be abrupt or gradual. Common initial symptoms often include:

   - Difficulty with walking or climbing stairs
   - Unexpected numbness, tingling, or sudden pain in the legs
   - Weakness affecting one or both sides of the body

As the condition worsens, additional symptoms might manifest, such as:

   - Sudden, severe back pain
   - Loss of sensation in the legs
   - Problems with urination or bowel movements
   - Headaches
   - A stiff neck
   - Increased sensitivity to light

Without timely and appropriate treatment, spinal vascular malformations can progressively lead to disability due to damage to the spinal cord and nearby tissues. Potential complications may include:

   - Difficulties with movement (motor deficits)
   - Pain, tingling sensations, and numbness (sensory deficits)
   - Deformities of the spinal column
   - Bulging of a blood vessel (aneurysm)
   - Increased blood pressure in the veins (venous hypertension), which can cause fluid accumulation (edema) and tissue death from lack of oxygen (spinal cord infarction)
   - Bleeding (haemorrhage), which can accelerate damage to the spinal cord

Spinal vascular malformations can be challenging to diagnose due to their symptoms often mirroring those of other spinal conditions, such as spinal dural arteriovenous fistula, spinal stenosis, multiple sclerosis, or a spinal cord tumor.

To determine the cause of your symptoms, your doctor will likely recommend several tests, including:

   - **Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI):** This imaging test uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves to produce detailed images of your spinal cord. An MRI can help identify abnormalities such as a mass resulting from irregularly connected blood vessels often seen in vascular malformations.

   - **Angiography:** This test is typically required to pinpoint the exact location and characteristics of the blood vessels involved in the malformation. During an angiography, a slender tube, known as a catheter, is inserted into an artery in the groin and carefully directed towards the spinal cord. A dye is then injected into the blood vessels in the spinal cord, making them visible under X-ray imaging. This helps provide a clearer picture of any vascular irregularities.

Treating spinal vascular malformations typically involves a combination of methods aimed at alleviating symptoms and minimizing the risk of potential complications. The treatment plan is customized based on various factors such as the size, location, and blood flow of the malformation, your neurological exam findings, and your overall health status.

The primary aim of treating spinal vascular malformations is to mitigate the risk of bleeding and halt or prevent the progression of disability and other symptoms. Given the close proximity of the malformation to the spinal cord, surgery for spinal vascular malformations is often a technically demanding and complex procedure.

Medications to relieve pain may be prescribed to manage symptoms like back discomfort and stiffness. However, many spinal vascular malformations might ultimately necessitate surgical intervention.

## Surgery

Surgical removal of the malformation is sometimes required. There are three main surgical approaches. In this method, a surgeon makes an incision in the skin to remove the malformation, ensuring careful avoidance of the spinal cord and nearby regions. This approach is generally favored when the malformation is relatively small and situated in an easily accessible area of the spinal cord.

## Endovascular Embolisation

This is a minimally invasive procedure, often used to reduce the risk of bleeding and other complications related to spinal vascular malformations. A catheter is inserted into an artery in the leg and navigated to the artery in the spinal cord supplying the malformation. Small particles of a glue-like substance are then injected to block the artery, hence reducing blood flow into the malformation. This procedure doesn't permanently eliminate the malformation. Your doctor may suggest endovascular embolization before other types of surgery to lower the risk of bleeding during surgery or to shrink the malformation, making surgical removal more effective.

## Radiosurgery
This treatment uses targeted radiation to destroy the malformation's blood vessels. Over time, these vessels degenerate and close off. Radiosurgery is frequently employed to treat small, unruptured malformations.

## What is a Stroke?

A stroke is a medical emergency caused by a sudden interruption in the blood flow to the brain, leading to cell death due to lack of oxygen. This is often due to a blood clot blocking a vessel (ischaemic stroke) or bleeding in or around the brain (hemorrhagic stroke). When oxygen supply is cut off, neurological functions become impaired, manifesting in a variety of symptoms. The majority of strokes occurring in those over 65 years old

## Types of Stroke

There are two major categories of strokes:

1. **Ischaemic Stroke**: This is the most common type of stroke, accounting for about 87% of all cases. It is caused by a blood clot blocking a blood vessel in the brain, resulting in a lack of blood flow and oxygen to the brain tissue.

![Ischaemic stroke. ](img/ischaemic-stroke.svg)




2. **Hemorrhagic Stroke**: This is less common but can be more serious. It is caused by bleeding directly into the brain or the space around the brain, typically due to a ruptured blood vessel or an abnormal vascular structure.

![Hemorrhagic Stroke](img/haemorrhagic-stroke.svg)


## Symptoms

Symptoms of a stroke usually appear suddenly and may include:

- Weakness or numbness on one side of the body
- Drooping of one side of the face
- Difficulty in speaking or understanding
- Dizziness or loss of balance
- Loss of vision to one side
- Severe headache (typically in hemorrhagic stroke)

In some cases, the symptoms may be temporary, lasting a few minutes or persisting up to 24 hours. This is known as a transient ischaemic attack (TIA) or a "mini-stroke." Even if symptoms resolve they should be treated urgently as they often serve as a warning for an impending full stroke.

## Risk Factors

Key risk factors for stroke include high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, smoking, obesity, diabetes mellitus, a previous TIA, end-stage kidney disease, and atrial fibrillation.

## Diagnosis and Treatment

Stroke is diagnosed based on physical examination and medical imaging like CT scans or MRI scans. Other tests like ECG and blood tests help determine risk factors and rule out other causes.

Time is critical in stroke treatment. For ischaemic strokes, a medication that can break down the clot may be effective if given within the first few hours. Procedures may be necessary in certain instances to remove the obstructing blood clot, called mechanical thrombectomy.

Additionally, if the stroke leads to brain swelling surgery might be necessary to mitigate pressure on other parts of the brain.

## Prevention

Prevention measures include managing risk factors, surgery for problematic carotid narrowing, and medication in certain cases.

## Long-term Implications

Strokes can have permanent symptoms such as persistent weakness, inability to walk and speak normally, and impaired vision. Stroke rehabilitation is essential to help recover lost functions.

## Recognizing the Symptoms of a Stroke

A stroke can be a life-threatening condition, and it's crucial to recognise the signs and act quickly to get medical help. If you suspect that you or someone else is experiencing a stroke, it's essential to seek medical help immediately. Rapid action can significantly improve outcomes and reduce the long-term effects of a stroke. Remember, every minute counts.


## 1. Understanding Stroke Symptoms

A stroke can cause a range of symptoms, depending on which part of the brain is affected. These symptoms usually begin suddenly and may not progress further.

Symptoms of stroke can include:

- **Hemiplegia and muscle weakness**: This can affect your face or cause one arm to drift downward when you try to raise it.
- **Numbness or reduced sensory sensation**: You may experience this on one side of your body or face.
- **Speech difficulty**: You may find it hard to speak clearly or to understand what others are saying.
- **Vision problems**: You may lose vision in one or both eyes, or see double.
- **Severe headache**: This may occur with a hemorrhagic stroke, which involves bleeding in the brain.
- **Balance problems and vertigo**: You may feel dizzy, unsteady or have difficulty walking.

## 2. Remember the FAST Mnemonic

To help you remember the main symptoms of a stroke, you can use the FAST mnemonic:

- **F (Face)**: Ask the person to smile. Does one side of the face droop?
- **A (Arms)**: Ask the person to raise both arms. Does one arm drift downward?
- **S (Speech)**: Ask the person to repeat a simple phrase. Is their speech slurred or strange?
- **T (Time)**: If you observe any of these signs, call your local emergency number immediately.

## 3. Other Symptoms

Depending on the exact part of the brain affected by the stroke, specific symptoms may be experienced:

- **Problems with taste, smell, hearing or vision**
- **Drooping of an eyelid and weakness of ocular muscles**
- **Decreased reflexes, such as a reduced gag or swallow reflex**
- **Altered breathing and heart rate**
- **Confusion or lack of insight into their disability**
- **Difficulty with voluntary movements (apraxia) or issues with coordination**

The more extensive the area of the brain affected, the more functions are likely to be lost.

## 5. Regular Check-ups

If you have any risk factors for a stroke, such as high blood pressure, obesity, diabetes or a previous mini-stroke (TIA), it's important to have regular check-ups with your doctor. They can help you manage your risk and possibly prevent a stroke from occurring.

The symptoms of a stroke can be alarming. Knowing what to look for and acting quickly can make a significant difference. Remember, if you suspect a stroke, don't wait — seek help immediately.

Diagnosing a stroke involves the use of imaging technologies to view the brain and detect any abnormalities. Let's delve into the details of how doctors diagnose a stroke.

Radiology scans are the primary diagnostic tools for identifying stroke. They help distinguish between ischaemic stroke (caused by a blockage) and haemorrhagic stroke (caused by bleeding).

## Computed Tomography (CT) Scan

A CT scan of the brain is often the first imaging modality used in suspected stroke cases because it is quick, affordable, and widely available. While CT is excellent for excluding haemorrhage, it has limited sensitivity in detecting an ischemic stroke in the acute setting. Over time, however, the effects of stroke become more pronounced and obvious on CT scans.

The main goals of an acute CT scan are to:
1. Exclude intracranial haemorrhage, which would rule out the use of thrombolytic therapy.
2. Look for early signs of ischemia.
3. Exclude other conditions that might mimic a stroke, such as a brain tumor.

## CT Angiography

CT angiography involves the injection of a contrast dye into the veins to  identify clots within an intracranial blood vessel, provide insights into the stroke's etiology, assess the carotid and vertebral arteries in the neck, and help to guide intra-arterial thrombolysis or clot retrieval.


## CT Perfusion

CT perfusion is another type of test involving the injection of a contrast dye that can increase the accuracy of stroke diagnosis and helps to determine patient selection for reperfusion therapy. It enables the visualisation of the infarct core (the area of the brain that will not recover) and the penumbra (the area of the brain that is starved of oxygen but has not yet infarcted and may still be salvaged).

## Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)

MRI provides higher sensitivity and specificity than CT for diagnosing acute ischemic stroke. However, it is more time-consuming and not as readily available as CT. MR angiography can also be performed which is similar to CT angiography, and can help identify the location of the blood clot. MR angiography does not necessitate the injection of dye, however.


## 3. Further Investigations

Once a stroke has been diagnosed, additional studies are conducted to determine the underlying cause. These may include:

-  Ultrasound/Doppler study: These tests look at the carotid arteries to detect narrowing (stenosis) or a tear in the artery wall (dissection).
- Electrocardiogram (ECG) and Echocardiogram : These heart tests can identify irregular heart rhythms and clots that could lead to stroke.
-  Holter monitor : This device is worn for 24 to 72 hours to identify intermittent abnormal heart rhythms.
- Angiogram: This procedure involves injecting a contrast dye into the blood vessels to make them visible under X-rays. It can identify any abnormalities such as aneurysms or arteriovenous malformations.
- Blood tests: Various blood tests are conducted to identify possible stroke causes, such as high cholesterol or an abnormal bleeding tendency.

Stroke treatment involves immediate interventions like thrombolysis and thrombectomy, neurosurgical procedures, and supportive care, followed by long-term risk factor management. This article delves into these strategies, outlining their significance in stroke recovery and future stroke prevention.


## Thrombolysis

Thrombolysis, a procedure involving the dissolution of blood clots, plays a crucial role in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke. It is especially effective when administered within the first three hours of symptom onset. Using recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA), a 10% overall benefit regarding living without disability can be achieved, although this treatment does not improve chances of survival. The sooner it's administered, the greater the benefits.

However, the effect of thrombolysis becomes less certain when administered between three and four and a half hours after symptom onset. Beyond four and a half hours, thrombolysis can result in adverse outcomes. Certain patients with findings of salvageable tissue on medical imaging between 4.5 hours and 9 hours after symptom onset, or those who wake up with a stroke, may still benefit from alteplase treatment.

Endorsements for the use of thrombolysis come from reputable organizations such as the American Heart Association, the American College of Emergency Physicians, and the American Academy of Neurology. It's worth noting that 6.4% of patients with large strokes could experience substantial brain bleeding as a complication of rtPA administration, contributing to increased short-term mortality.

Intra-arterial fibrinolysis, where a catheter is passed up an artery into the brain and the medication is injected at the site of thrombosis, can also enhance outcomes in people with acute ischemic stroke.

## Mechanical thrombectomy

Thrombectomy is a surgical procedure for removing a blood clot. In mechanical thrombectomy, the procedure involves using a special retrieval device to remove the clot and restore normal blood flow. If the clot is removed before it causes permanent damage, the prognosis usually improves. It's performed globally in specialist hospitals and is suitable for many, but not all, stroke patients.

Risks associated with mechanical thrombectomy include potential failure to retrieve the clot, potential allergic reactions to contrast dye agents, and potential kidney dysfunction resulting from the excretion of the contrast agent. Additionally, the procedure requires general anesthesia, posing its own risks. More serious, but rarer, complications include severe brain injury, post-procedure brain bleeding, and radiation-induced health issues.

Mechanical thrombectomy is usually considered an emergency and potentially life-saving treatment. An alternative to thrombectomy is the administration of a ‘clot-busting’ thrombolytic drug, although this option may not be as effective or suitable for all patients due to various risk factors.

## Neurosurgical Intervention and Supportive Care

In certain cases, neurosurgical intervention can be employed to help patients survive the period of maximal swelling after a stroke. Such interventions include decompressive craniectomies, performed with or without duroplasty. These procedures are particularly useful for younger patients with large Middle Cerebral Artery (MCA) infarcts or posterior fossa infarcts.

Moreover, supportive care is integral to the treatment of stroke patients. This often involves dedicated inpatient stroke units to prevent the numerous complications encountered by stroke patients, such as aspiration pneumonia and pressure ulcers.

## Risk Factor Management in Stroke

Risk factor management is a fundamental part of stroke treatment and aims to reduce the chances of future stroke events. This involves lifestyle modifications, such as a balanced diet, regular exercise, smoking cessation, and limited alcohol consumption, combined with appropriate medical therapy. Underlying medical conditions, such as hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, and atrial fibrillation, need to be appropriately managed with the help of medication and lifestyle changes.

## What is carotid artery stenosis?

Carotid artery stenosis is a narrowing of one or both of the carotid arteries. These large arteries, found on each side of the neck, supply blood to the brain, face and head. Narrowing usually happens because of atherosclerosis, where fatty deposits (plaques) build up inside the artery wall.

When healthy, arteries are smooth and open, allowing blood to flow freely. With stenosis, the passage narrows, making blood flow less efficient. The main danger comes when plaque or a blood clot breaks away and travels into the brain, blocking smaller arteries. This can cause a stroke or, if the blockage is temporary, a transient ischaemic attack (TIA).

## How common is carotid stenosis and why does it matter?

Carotid artery stenosis becomes more common with age. It is estimated that up to 5% of the general population may have some degree of narrowing. Around 10–15% of all ischaemic strokes are linked to carotid stenosis. Because stroke is one of the leading causes of disability and death, recognising and managing carotid stenosis is important.

## Causes and risk factors

The most common cause is atherosclerosis, but several factors increase the risk of developing it:

* Smoking
* High blood pressure
* High cholesterol
* Diabetes
* Obesity and lack of exercise
* Older age
* A history of cardiovascular disease

These risks often combine, making lifestyle changes and medical treatment essential in slowing or preventing disease progression.

## Symptoms

Many people with carotid artery stenosis do not have symptoms until the narrowing becomes severe or causes an event. Possible symptoms include:

* A transient ischaemic attack (TIA) with sudden weakness, speech problems or numbness lasting less than 24 hours
* Stroke with more permanent neurological symptoms
* Temporary loss of vision in one eye, described as a dark curtain coming across the vision (amaurosis fugax)

If stenosis has not yet caused symptoms, it is often discovered incidentally, for example when a doctor hears a bruit in the neck.

## How carotid stenosis is diagnosed

The first-line test is duplex ultrasound, a painless scan that uses sound waves to measure blood flow and detect narrowing. If intervention is considered, further imaging such as CT angiography or MR angiography can give more precise information about the artery’s structure and the location of the plaque.

## Treatment approaches

The treatment of carotid artery stenosis has two main aims: to reduce the risk of stroke and to manage risk factors for atherosclerosis.

Medical treatment is important for everyone with carotid stenosis. This usually involves antiplatelet therapy (such as aspirin), cholesterol-lowering medication, strict blood pressure and diabetes control, and lifestyle measures such as stopping smoking and maintaining a healthy weight.

When the narrowing is severe (often 70% or more) and the patient has already had symptoms such as a TIA or stroke, a procedure to reopen the artery can greatly reduce the chance of another stroke.

## Carotid revascularisation

Revascularisation means restoring blood flow by opening the blocked artery. Two main procedures are used:

* **Carotid endarterectomy**, where the surgeon makes an incision in the neck, opens the artery and physically removes the plaque.
* **Carotid stenting**, where a stent (a small metal mesh tube) is placed inside the artery to hold it open and keep blood flowing.

Both procedures carry risks, and the choice depends on factors such as the patient’s overall health, anatomy of the blockage and local expertise.

## Carotid stenting in detail

Carotid stenting is a minimally invasive treatment designed to reduce the risk of stroke in people with significant carotid stenosis. Instead of making a large incision in the neck, doctors use thin tubes (catheters) to reach the carotid artery, usually through an artery in the leg (femoral access), sometimes the arm (radial access), or directly through the neck just above the collarbone (a technique called TCAR, or transcarotid artery revascularisation).

A small balloon may be used to widen the artery before placing the stent. The stent is then positioned across the narrowed segment. Once expanded, it stays in place permanently, acting as a scaffold that keeps the artery open. Modern procedures also use protection devices or flow-reversal systems to reduce the chance of plaque debris travelling into the brain during the procedure.

## Benefits and outcomes of stenting

Carotid stenting offers several advantages compared with open surgery: it is less invasive, involves smaller or no neck incisions, and usually has a shorter recovery time. For most patients, blood flow improves immediately, lowering the risk of stroke.

Studies show that stenting and endarterectomy have similar long-term effectiveness, though stenting may carry a slightly higher risk of minor stroke, while endarterectomy carries a higher risk of nerve injury. Both procedures are generally durable, with more than 95% of patients maintaining good artery function long-term.

## Risks of stenting

Like any procedure, carotid stenting has potential risks, including stroke, bleeding at the puncture site, damage to the artery, low or high blood pressure during the procedure, or, rarely, death. The risks vary depending on the severity of the disease and the patient’s overall health.

## Life after stenting

Carotid stenting does not cure atherosclerosis. Patients must continue with risk factor control and medication to prevent further plaque build-up, both in the treated artery and elsewhere in the circulation. Regular follow-up imaging of the carotid arteries is recommended.

Most patients return to normal activities within a week. Long-term success depends on maintaining healthy lifestyle habits, taking prescribed medicines, and keeping blood pressure, cholesterol and diabetes well controlled.

## What is an interventional neuroradiology doctor?

Interventional neuroradiologists, otherwise known as neurointerventional radiologists, neurointerventionalists, or endovascular neurosurgeons, are doctors who perform procedures upon the brain or spine without making large incisions. Instead the minimally invasive procedures are performed through the blood vessels, or through small needles. The use of “neuro” in “Neurointerventional” means we particularly focus on treatments for disease or disorders of the nervous system located within the head, neck and spine systems of the body. They use advanced imaging equipment to guide their procedures.

## Are interventional neuroradiologists surgeons?

Doctors who perform interventional neuroradiology procedures undergo many years of specialised training and may come from backgrounds in radiology, surgery, or neurology. The field is also known as neurointervention or endovascular neurosurgery. Unlike traditional open neurosurgery—which requires opening the skull and operating under a microscope—interventional neuroradiology uses minimally invasive techniques. Despite the different approaches, both specialties often treat the same conditions, such as aneurysms and arteriovenous malformations (AVMs).

## Are these techniques safe or are they considered experimental?

Interventional neuroradiology employs techniques that have been proven, through rigorous clinical trials, to be safe and effective. Many vascular diseases of the brain and spine, previously treated through open surgery, can now be treated with reduced complication rates associated with the interventional neuroradiology. As an added benefit there is usually reduced pain and shorter recovery time. Neurointerventionalists work closely with other specialists including neurosurgeons to ensure that the correct treatment is chosen. Many of our patients are referred to us by our surgical colleagues who also recognize the benefits of minimally invasive treatments.

## What are the most common types of diseases that are treated?

There are many conditions treated by interventional neuroradiologists.

Brain aneurysms are bulges on the wall of an artery. We treat them before they burst to prevent a stroke. In the emergency setting we also treat aneurysms that have already burst to stop further bleeding. Approximately 3% of the population have brain aneurysms, however not all of these are dangerous and need treating.

We treat stroke patients by removing the clot which is blocking the artery in the brain. If this is done quickly enough (normally just a few hours after the stroke onset) then the prognosis is much better. Stroke is one of the leading causes of death in the United Kingdom.

We treat stenosis (narrowing) in the blood vessels of the neck or brain using stents or balloons in order to increase the blood flow and prevent stroke.

We treat a disease called arteriovenous fistula, which is an abnormal connection between arteries and veins within the brain or spine. This causes abnormally high pressure in the veins and can lead to symptoms such as tinnitus, vision or hearing loss, or stroke. A related condition, known as arteriovenous malformation, can also often be treated using interventional techniques.

We often treat patients with tumours of the brain, face, or neck who are going to have a surgical resection. We can often shrink the tumour down by blocking the blood flow (embolisation) using tiny particles.

A common procedure that we perform is called a cerebral angiogram. “Cerebral” meaning brain, “angio-” meaning blood vessel, and “-gram” indicating that an X-ray is being performed. This is a diagnostic, minimally invasive procedure to diagnose diseases of the blood vessels of the brain.

## How do interventional neuroradiologists perform their procedures?

This is achieved via inserting a tiny tube called a catheter into an artery or vein. The usual entrance site is the groin or the wrist, as these are easily accessible and safe places. We then advance the tube into the blood vessel involved in the disease process. We can place tiny devices, such as coils or stents, or retrieve blood clots, through these tubes. As the tubes inside the body we use advanced imaging equipment, such as X-rays, CT, or MRI to guide them.

A CT scan, or computed tomography scan, is an imaging test that uses X-rays and computer processing to create detailed cross-sectional pictures of the body. It is quick, precise, and widely used in emergency and inpatient settings because it can rapidly detect conditions such as bleeding, fractures, and organ injury.

In interventional neuroradiology, CT is particularly important for assessing conditions affecting the brain and blood vessels, such as haemorrhage or stroke, and in the evaluation of cerebral aneurysms. CT angiography (CTA) involves the injection of intravenous contrast dye to highlight arteries and veins, allowing clinicians to detect aneurysms, vessel narrowing, or arteriovenous malformations with high accuracy. It is often the first-line vascular imaging technique because it is fast, widely available, and non-invasive.

Compared with MRI, CT is usually preferred in urgent cases, such as suspected aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage or acute stroke, because it can be performed rapidly and is excellent at showing fresh blood. MRI, by contrast, offers greater detail of soft tissue and vessel walls without radiation but takes longer, is less available in emergencies, and is more affected by patient movement.

CT scanning has clear advantages: it is quick, precise, and excellent for detecting bleeding and vascular pathology with CTA. Its disadvantages include the use of ionising radiation and the possibility of artefacts, particularly when metal devices such as coils or stents have already been placed, which can obscure detail in follow-up imaging.

MRI scanning, or magnetic resonance imaging, uses powerful magnets and radio waves rather than X-rays to generate detailed images of the body. It provides exceptional contrast between different soft tissues and can create images in multiple planes without moving the patient. Unlike CT, MRI does not involve ionising radiation, which makes it particularly valuable for repeated imaging or for younger patients.

In interventional neuroradiology, MRI plays a central role in the assessment of brain and spinal conditions. It is highly sensitive for detecting ischaemia in stroke, small vascular malformations, and brain or spinal cord pathology that may not be visible on CT. It also contributes to the evaluation of aneurysms and subarachnoid haemorrhage, as it can demonstrate vessel walls, surrounding brain tissue, and the effects of blood products at different stages. MRI is especially valuable in detecting aneurysms located in regions that may be obscured by bone on CT, such as the skull base or posterior circulation, where its superior soft tissue contrast provides clearer information.

Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) is a specialised application that allows blood vessels to be imaged with or without intravenous contrast. Contrast-enhanced MRA uses gadolinium-based agents to improve vascular detail, while non-contrast techniques rely on blood flow signals to depict arteries and veins. This makes MRA particularly useful for detecting aneurysms, arteriovenous malformations, and vessel stenosis, as well as for long-term follow-up and surveillance, often avoiding the need for repeated radiation exposure.

The advantages of MRI and MRA are their excellent soft tissue detail, the absence of radiation, and the ability to evaluate both vessels and surrounding structures in a single examination. They are also especially effective in areas where CT is limited by bone. Limitations include longer scanning times, sensitivity to patient movement, and contraindications in patients with certain implants or severe claustrophobia. Metallic devices such as coils or stents can cause artefacts, although these are often less pronounced than in CT. For this reason, MRI and MRA are typically used in planned or follow-up settings, while CT and CTA are preferred for rapid emergency imaging.

## What is a cerebral angiogram?

An angiogram is an X-ray test that produces high-resolution images of the blood vessels. Cerebral angiograms produce imaging of the blood vessels of the head and neck.

The test involves insertion of a tube in the groin or wrist that is then navigated through the body to the vessel of interest. An iodine based dye (known as 'contrast') is then injected through the tube.

Why is cerebral angiography performed?
Cerebral angiograms are commonly performed to diagnose diseases of the blood vessels such as:

* Cerebral aneurysms

* Carotid stenosis

* Dural arteriovenous fistulas

They are also used to follow-up diseases previously treated.

## Why not just do a CT or MRI?

The image quality is often superior when using angiography, allowing the discovery of diseases that do not show up on alternative scans and allowing the planning of certain procedures. As CT and MRI scans are safer, faster, and usually more pleasant to undergo we only do cerebral angiograms when we need to. Having said that, generally the risk (and degree of unpleasantness) is not usually very great.

## Can I eat or drink before the procedure?

In some hospitals you may be given instructions not to eat or drink for a few hours before the procedure. This main reason for this is just in case general anaesthesia or sedation is needed during the procedure. Anaesthetists ideally do not like you to have food or drink in the stomach if you are to have general anaesthesia as there is a risk of regurgitation in to the lungs.

Having said this, the great majority of angiograms do not require general anaesthesia or sedation and so in many other hospitals you are allowed to have a light breakfast before coming to hospital and drink clear fluids until the examination. Exact instructions will be given to you before your angiogram.

## Should I take my normal medications?

You should take your medication as usual unless instructed otherwise (this includes any aspirin-based or anti-platelet medication, for example clopidogrel). You can take your normal medication with small sips of water.

## I have allergies. Can I still take the test?
It is important to inform the staff if you have any allergies. It is especially important to mention allergies to:

Iodine or iodine based contrast agents.

Latex.

Plasters.

Cleaning solutions such as chlorhexidine.

## Can I have an angiogram if I am pregnant?

Cerebral angiograms involve small doses of radiation, but usually directed towards the head. The dose to any developing foetus is very low, and can be further lowered by wearing protective lead clothing. Angiograms are sometimes performed in emergency settings where there may be a danger to the mother if they are not performed. However, if the procedure can be avoided by performing an alternative test, or delayed until after the pregnancy this is preferred. If you are pregnant, trying to get pregnant, or if there is any chance that you could possibly be pregnant however unlikely, please inform the staff.

## Are blood tests necessary?

At least a few days before the procedure you may have routine blood tests performed, although this is not always necessary if you are in good health otherwise.

about: "While cerebral angiograms are generally safe, rare complications include stroke (approx. 0.5% risk), bleeding, artery injury, urinary dye reaction, and risk at the access site."

Any medical procedure can involve risks. It is first important to understand that a cerebral angiogram is recommended when the risks involved in not undertaking the test (for example, non-diagnosis of a serious disease) outweigh the risks of the procedure.

The overwhelming majority of patients undergoing cerebral angiography do not have a complication. However, if a complication does occur, it can be significant.

## Stroke

The main potential complication of cerebral angiography is of having a stroke, with a rate of approximately 0.5% (or 1 in 200 people). This risk varies and is likely lower if you are normally in good health without other disease. A stroke is caused by a blood clot obstructing the normal flow of blood to the brain. The symptoms can involve one or more of the following: weakness of the face, arms, or legs, difficulty with speech, or difficulty with vision. Strokes can also be of variable severity: from brief and barely noticeable to very severe. They can be temporary or result in permanent deficit. The good news is that strokes that result from cerebral angiogram tend to be of lesser severity with good potential for recovery. As strokes tend to occur during, or shortly after the procedure you are also in the best place (under direct medical supervision) if they were to occur.

## Bleeding from the access site

The second main risk is of damage to the artery at the access site. It is common to get small amount of bleeding after the procedure and this usually stops spontaneously. If the bleeding is heavier or if there is internal bleeding then this sometimes require treatment, such as an injection of thrombin or even surgical repair. It is very rare for this to be necessary, however. The risk is lower if the wrist (rather than the groin) is used as the access site.

## Blockage of the access site artery

Another rare complication is blockage of the artery at the access site, resulting in not enough blood getting to the arm or leg. This condition may require surgery to remedy.

about: "During a cerebral angiogram, a catheter is guided through the wrist or groin into vessels, contrast is injected, and X-ray imaging is used to produce detailed vascular images. The procedure typically takes 30 minutes to 2 hours."
mainEntity: "https://www.nhs.uk/tests-and-treatments/angiography/what-happens/"
sameAs: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiography#Procedure"
---


## What happens on the day?

Typically you would enter the hospital on the day of the procedure. A nurse will go through your medical history. You will then be given a gown to wear during the procedure and remove your underwear. You will then be consented for the procedure by a doctor. You should use the toilet before the procedure.

The angiogram is done in a dedicated angiography suite where you will lie flat on the table. In the room there will be members of the team who help to perform the procedure, including a nurse, a radiographer/technologist (who will help operate the machine), and a doctor (usually an interventional neuroradiologist) who will perform the procedure.

## The procedure

The wrist or groin is usually the site that is used for delivery of the instruments for the procedure and this is shaved and cleaned with sterile solution. Drapes are then placed around the site. The doctor will inject a small amount of local anaesthesia (which unfortunately stings when it goes in) to numb the skin. They will then insert a plastic tube in to the artery and navigate a long thin plastic tube called a catheter through the body and in to the blood vessels of the neck. Through this tube 'contrast' dye is injected whilst performing an X-ray to obtain images of the blood vessels. You do not feel the tube as it passes through the blood vessels in your body as they have no sensory receptors. You may feel some pushing and pulling at the groin.

The x-ray machines will move into position over your head. They will move around you during the procedure but will not touch you. You may experience funny sensations such as flashing lights in the eyes, hot or cold over the side of the face, a funny taste in the mouth, or pressure at the back of the head during the examination. These are all normal and tend to pass within a few seconds.. They result from the contrast dye travelling through the blood vessels. The whole examination usually takes less than an hour, although the time can be variable due to the ease or difficulty of the procedure.

It is very important you stay still throughout the procedure to ensure the pictures taken are as clear as possible. If you feel unwell or in pain please let us know. You can talk to your doctor during the exam.

After all the imaging is finished the tube in the access site is removed. If the puncture site was the groin sometimes a collagen "plug" is used to seal the blood vessel. Alternatively, usually just applying firm pressure to the blood vessel for 10 minutes is sufficient as the hole is fairly small. If the puncture site was the wrist then an inflatable compression device is applied for a few hours after.

sameAs: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiography"
---


## What happens after the exam?

You will be monitored by a nurse for a few hours after the angiogram. If the access site was the groin you will be instructed to lie flat for a variable length of time (typically over 1 hour but less than 6 hours). The nursing staff will carry out regular observations, including checking your groin site and foot pulses. You should be able to eat and drink on returning to the ward, but please check with nursing staff first. Sometimes patients experience some bruising around the groin. This is nothing to worry about and will fade over a few days.

Most people can go home on the same day as the procedure. It is not advised to use public transport after you’ve had an angiogram in case you feel unwell, so it’s important that you make arrangements for someone to collect you from the ward and take you home by car.

## What should I do when I return home?

You should make advance arrangements for someone to stay with you for 24 hours after you get home. To avoid provoking bleeding at the access site avoid strenuous activities such as heavy lifting, running and cycling for 1 week. Do not operate machinery or drive for 48 hours.

## When will I receive the results?

Sometimes the doctor can tell you at the end of the procedure. It is not unusual, however, for it to be necessary for the images to be analysed on a computer before they can be interpreted. In this case the final results will be delivered later at a clinic attendance or over the phone.


# About the brain {Essential knowledge}

tags: Essential knowledge
keywords: "brain anatomy, cerebral hemispheres, cerebellum, brainstem, Circle of Willis, London"
about: "The brain coordinates movement, senses, memory, language and vital functions. It requires a dense vascular network to supply oxygen and remove wastes. Interruptions in circulation can result in serious conditions such as stroke or aneurysm."
mainEntity: "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK234157/"  # Major Structures & Functions of the Brain
sameAs: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_brain"
---


The brain is the most complex organ in the body. It coordinates movement, sensation, language, memory, and thought, while also regulating unconscious functions such as breathing, heart rate, and sleep. Although it makes up only about 2% of body weight, the brain uses around 20% of the body’s oxygen and energy supply.

To meet these demands, the brain relies on a dense and highly specialised network of blood vessels. These arteries and veins are arranged to deliver oxygen-rich blood to different regions of the brain and to remove waste products efficiently. Even short interruptions in this blood supply can cause damage to brain cells, which is why vascular problems such as **stroke, aneurysms, or intracranial haemorrhage** can have rapid and severe consequences.

The surface of the brain is folded into ridges (gyri) and grooves (sulci), which allow a large surface area to fit within the skull. Different regions are specialised:

* The **cerebral hemispheres** control higher functions like speech, movement, sensation, reasoning, and memory.
* The **cerebellum**, at the back of the brain, fine-tunes balance and coordination.
* The **brainstem**, at the base, connects the brain to the spinal cord and regulates vital life functions.

All of these regions depend on a delicate balance between structure and circulation. The protective layers (meninges), the fluid spaces (ventricles and subarachnoid space), and the branching arterial system together form an environment that supports healthy brain activity but is vulnerable to disruption when disease affects the vessels.


## Brain Coverings and Fluid

* **Meninges** – Three thin layers of tissue that cover and protect the brain and spinal cord (dura, arachnoid, and pia mater).
* **Subarachnoid space** – The space between these layers where clear fluid flows.
* **Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)** – A cushioning fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord, helping to protect them from injury.
* **Ventricles** – Fluid-filled spaces inside the brain where CSF is made and circulated.

## Blood Supply to the Brain

The brain receives blood through four main arteries in the neck:

* **Carotid arteries** (front of the neck) – Carry blood to the front and middle parts of the brain.
* **Vertebral arteries** (back of the neck) – Join together to form the basilar artery, supplying the back of the brain.

Together, these arteries form a ring at the base of the brain called the **Circle of Willis**, which helps provide an alternative route for blood flow if one vessel is narrowed or blocked.

## Intracranial Arteries – The Brain’s Blood Highways

Once blood reaches the base of the brain it travels along smaller arteries that spread across the brain’s surface and deep into its tissues. These are known as the **intracranial arteries**.

The main groups are:

* **Anterior cerebral arteries (ACA)**

  * Branch from the carotid arteries.
  * Supply blood to the front and inner parts of the brain, including areas that control movement and sensation of the legs.

* **Middle cerebral arteries (MCA)**

  * The largest branches of the carotid arteries.
  * Provide blood to much of the outer surface of the brain, especially areas involved in speech, movement, sensation of the face and arms, and vision.
  * Blockage here is the most common cause of major stroke.

* **Posterior cerebral arteries (PCA)**

  * Arise from the back circulation (vertebral–basilar system).
  * Supply the back of the brain, especially the **occipital lobes**, which control vision, and parts of the temporal lobes, which help with memory.

* **Basilar artery**

  * Formed by the joining of the two vertebral arteries.
  * Supplies the brainstem and cerebellum—vital for balance, coordination, and life-sustaining functions like breathing.

These arteries are linked together by small connecting vessels, the anterior and posterior communicating arteries, that form the **Circle of Willis**. This network helps protect the brain: if one pathway becomes narrowed or blocked, blood can sometimes still reach the affected area through alternative routes.

# About the spine {Essential knowledge}

The spine, or **vertebral column**, forms the central supporting structure of the body. It protects the spinal cord, allows upright posture, and provides flexibility for movement. The spine is made up of 33 vertebrae, stacked one on top of the other, separated by discs that act as shock absorbers.

Running through the centre of the vertebrae is the **spinal canal**, which contains the spinal cord and its protective coverings. The spinal cord is a continuation of the brainstem and acts as the main communication highway between the brain and the rest of the body. Nerves branch off the cord through small openings in the vertebrae, carrying signals to and from muscles, skin, and organs.

Just like the brain, the spinal cord depends on a constant blood supply. Interruption of this supply, due to narrowing, blockage, or bleeding in the spinal vessels, can cause loss of function, weakness, or paralysis.

tags: Essential knowledge
keywords: "spine anatomy, spinal cord, vertebrae, spinal nerves, spinal blood supply, London"
about: "The spine supports the body, protects the spinal cord, and allows motion. The spinal cord relays signals between brain and body; its function depends on a fine vascular supply, and injury or disease can lead to serious deficits."
mainEntity: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"
sameAs: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord"
---



* **Cervical spine** – The top 7 vertebrae (neck region). Supports the head and allows movement such as turning and nodding.
* **Thoracic spine** – The next 12 vertebrae (upper and mid-back). These connect to the ribs and help protect the chest organs.
* **Lumbar spine** – 5 vertebrae in the lower back. These bear much of the body’s weight and allow bending and twisting.
* **Sacrum and coccyx** – The base of the spine, fused bones that connect to the pelvis.

## Spinal Cord and Nerves

The spinal cord is divided into regions that correspond with the spine: cervical, thoracic, lumbar, and sacral. Each region gives rise to pairs of **spinal nerves**, which exit the spine through small gaps between vertebrae. These nerves carry:

* **Motor signals** – from the brain to the muscles (movement).
* **Sensory signals** – from the skin and body back to the brain (touch, pain, temperature).
* **Autonomic signals** – to organs, controlling functions such as blood pressure, bladder, and bowel control.

## Coverings and Fluid

* **Meninges** – As in the brain, three protective layers (dura, arachnoid, pia mater) surround the spinal cord.
* **Subarachnoid space** – The space between these layers where **cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)** circulates.
* **CSF** – Cushions the spinal cord, provides nutrients, and helps remove waste products.

## Blood Supply to the Spine

The spinal cord is supplied by a network of arteries:

* **Anterior spinal artery** – Runs along the front of the cord, supplying the majority of the spinal cord tissue.
* **Posterior spinal arteries** – Run along the back of the cord.
* **Radicular and segmental arteries** – Branches from larger vessels (such as the aorta) that reinforce the spinal circulation at different levels.

Because the spinal cord relies on this delicate blood supply, any blockage or bleed can cause serious neurological problems, such as weakness, numbness, or loss of bladder and bowel control.

tags: IIH
keywords: "idiopathic intracranial hypertension, IIH, pseudotumour cerebri, raised intracranial pressure, London"
about: "Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a condition where pressure inside the skull is too high with no clear cause. It can damage vision if untreated, and is more common in young women with obesity."
mainEntity: "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/intracranial-hypertension/"  :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
sameAs: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic_intracranial_hypertension"  :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
---


## What is IIH?

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension is a condition where the pressure inside the skull is too high without a clear cause.

* **Idiopathic** means no known cause.
* **Intracranial** means inside the skull.
* **Hypertension** means high pressure.

The pressure rises because the fluid that cushions the brain and spinal cord (cerebrospinal fluid or CSF) builds up. This can press on the brain and the optic nerves, which are needed for sight.

IIH was previously called **pseudotumour cerebri** because its symptoms can resemble those of a brain tumour, however there is no tumour.

## How common is it?

IIH is uncommon. On average about 5 in 100,000 people are diagnosed each year. It is more common in young women with obesity.

## Is it serious?

IIH is not usually life-threatening. However, without treatment it can cause permanent changes to your vision. Early assessment and treatment help protect your sight and reduce symptoms.

## What causes it?

The exact cause is not known. Possible factors include:

* Problems with how CSF flows and is absorbed.
* Narrowing of large veins in the brain (venous sinuses), which can slow drainage and raise pressure.

## Is it inherited?

There is no proven hereditary link at present.

## Who is more at risk?

Anyone can develop IIH, but the risk is higher if you:

* Have a body mass index (BMI) over 30.
* Are female.
* Are aged 20 to 45.

# Symptoms {IIH}

description: The symptoms of idiopathic intracranial hypertension, such as headache, vision changes, pulsatile tinnitus, and optic nerve swelling.
tags: IIH
keywords: "IIH symptoms, headache, papilloedema, pulsatile tinnitus, vision loss"
about: "Symptoms arise from raised intracranial pressure. These include severe headache, visual symptoms (blurring, blind spots), pulsatile tinnitus, and papilloedema. If not treated, vision may be permanently lost."
mainEntity: "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/intracranial-hypertension/"  :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
sameAs: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic_intracranial_hypertension#Signs_and_symptoms"  :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
---


## What symptoms can it cause?

* Headaches that can be severe, with nausea or vomiting.
* Visual symptoms, such as brief episodes of dimming or loss of vision, blurred vision, double vision or blind spots. If untreated this can rarely lead to permanent sight loss.
* A whooshing or pulsing noise in the ears in time with your heartbeat (pulsatile tinnitus).
* Swelling of the optic nerves seen on an eye exam (papilloedema). This can be in one or both eyes and may not cause symptoms at first.

# Diagnosis {IIH}

sameAs: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic_intracranial_hypertension#Diagnosis"  :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}
---

## How is IIH diagnosed?

Tests usually include:

1. **Eye tests**, including visual fields, to check for blind spots and optic nerve swelling.
2. **Brain imaging** with MRI or CT to exclude other problems and look for features that fit with raised pressure.
3. **Lumbar puncture (spinal tap)** to measure CSF pressure and test the fluid.

Doctors use agreed criteria to make the diagnosis. These include symptoms of raised pressure, no other cause found on examination or scans, and raised CSF pressure on lumbar puncture.

The goals are to lower the pressure, relieve symptoms and protect your sight. Your plan is tailored to you and depends on how severe your symptoms and eye findings are.

## Weight management

If you are living with obesity, weight loss often helps reduce pressure and symptoms. Your team can support you with a structured weight management programme.

## Medicines

* **Acetazolamide or topiramate** to reduce CSF production.
* **Diuretics (water tablets)** in some cases to reduce fluid retention.

## Procedures and surgery

Used when vision is at risk, symptoms are severe, or medicines are not enough.

* **Venous sinus stenting**
  A tiny mesh tube (stent) is placed in a narrowed brain vein to improve drainage and lower pressure.

* **CSF shunt**
  A thin tube is placed to drain extra CSF from the brain to another part of the body. Shunts can relieve pressure but have a notable risk of blockage or needing further surgery.

* **Optic nerve sheath fenestration**
  Eye surgery that makes small openings in the covering of the optic nerve to release pressure and protect sight.

## Outlook (prognosis)

With timely treatment, most people improve and the risk of permanent sight loss falls. IIH does not usually affect life expectancy. Ongoing follow-up is important, especially regular eye checks.

## When is it considered?

* Your sight is at risk from IIH.
* Medicines have not worked well or cause side effects you cannot tolerate.
* Sometimes for severe pulsatile tinnitus or headaches that greatly affect quality of life.

## What does the procedure involve?

* You will usually have a general anaesthetic so you are asleep.
* A doctor inserts a thin tube into a vein at the top of the leg or wrist and guides it to the brain veins using X-ray imaging.
* Pressures are measured across the narrowed vein in the brain (venous sinus).
* A small mesh tube called a stent is placed to hold the vein open and improve drainage.
* You will take two antiplatelet medicines, usually for 6 months, then continue one long term as advised.
* Most people stay in hospital overnight and go home the next day.
* A follow-up CT or MR venogram is usually performed to assess the stents.

## What are the risks?

Figures below are approximate and depend on your individual health. Your team will discuss what they mean for you.

* Bleeding in the brain (intracranial haemorrhage) in fewer than 2 in 100 people.
* Temporary headaches are common, possibly in up to half of patients.
* Clotting or narrowing in or near the stent that may need further treatment in about 9 in 100 people.
* Permanent neurological problems in fewer than 2 in 100 people.
* A risk to life in fewer than 1 in 100 people.
* General risks linked to angiography, such as bruising at the puncture site or contrast allergy.

## Aftercare and follow-up

* Take your medicines exactly as prescribed, especially antiplatelets after stenting.
* Attend all eye and clinic appointments to monitor your vision and pressure.
* Seek urgent help if you have sudden worsening headache, new neurological symptoms, new or worsening visual loss, severe groin or wrist pain or swelling, or an allergic reaction.

## What is SIH?

Spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) happens when fluid that cushions the brain and spinal cord (cerebrospinal fluid, or CSF) leaks from the covering of the spine. The most common symptom is a sudden, ongoing headache that is worse when upright and better when lying flat. You may also notice neck stiffness, nausea, light sensitivity, ringing in the ears, reduced hearing, dizziness, or tiredness. Some people describe “brain fog”.

SIH can be caused by tiny tears in the spinal lining, small outpouchings that rupture, or a CSF-venous fistula where CSF drains abnormally into nearby veins. Finding the exact leak can be difficult. Brain scans can look normal and a lumbar puncture pressure can be normal. Special spinal imaging is often needed.

## How common is it?

SIH is more common than once thought. Around 4 to 5 people in every 100,000 develop it each year. It is seen more often in women and in people with connective tissue conditions such as Marfan syndrome, Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, or generalised joint hypermobility.

## Is it serious?

Yes, because symptoms can be very disabling. Untreated SIH can lead to complications in a small number of people. The good news is that most people improve with the right treatment. Early diagnosis and treatment give the best chance of full recovery.

## What causes it?

SIH is due to a CSF leak from the spine. Common patterns include:

* A tear on the front of the dura from a sharp disc or bony spur.
* A tear on the side of the dura due to thin or fragile tissue.
* A CSF-venous fistula where CSF drains into a spinal vein, often near a nerve root.
* A small leak from a nerve root sleeve into nearby soft tissues.

## Who is more at risk?

Women, and people with conditions that make connective tissues more stretchy or fragile, such as Marfan syndrome, Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, or general joint hypermobility.

## What symptoms can it cause?

Headache is common. It often starts as a positional headache, worse when upright and better when lying down. With time the pattern can change and may no longer be clearly positional. Some people have non-positional headaches, headaches that start after being upright for a while, cough or exertional headaches, thunderclap onset, or even headaches that feel worse when flat.

Other symptoms can include:

* Neck or between-shoulder-blade pain
* Nausea
* Ear and balance problems, such as tinnitus, dizziness, vertigo, imbalance, hearing change, or a feeling of fullness in the ear
* Blurred vision and light sensitivity
* Thinking or memory problems, from “brain fog” to more marked changes
* Tremor, slurred speech, swallowing difficulty, or Parkinsonism-like symptoms
* Tiredness
* Rarely, hormonal effects such as raised prolactin with possible milky nipple discharge

keywords: "SIH diagnosis, MRI, CT myelography, dynamic myelography, CSF leak"
about: "SIH diagnosis uses contrast MRI of brain and spine, CT or dynamic myelography, and sometimes lumbar puncture, although CSF pressure may be normal. Advanced imaging is often required to find the leak."

sameAs: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spontaneous_intracranial_hypotension#Diagnosis"  :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}
---


## MRI

A contrast brain MRI is usually the first test. Certain scan features can suggest a leak, although a normal brain MRI does not rule SIH out. Because most leaks start in the spine, a spinal MRI may also be done. This can show fluid outside the sac that holds the spinal cord, which helps guide further tests.

## LP

A lumbar puncture is not a reliable way to confirm or exclude SIH. The pressure can be low, normal, or occasionally high. SIH is mainly a problem of low CSF volume rather than always low pressure.

## Conventional CT myelography

This test injects contrast into the CSF and then scans with CT after a delay. It shows the CSF space well but often does not pinpoint the leak. It usually does not show CSF-venous fistulas.

## Dynamic myelography

This is the best test for finding fast leaks and CSF-venous fistulas. Contrast is injected into the CSF and imaging starts straight away using fluoroscopy or CT. Lying on the side and simple breathing or pressure manoeuvres can make a hidden fistula show up.

In simple terms, the fluoroscopic approach involves:

* Local anaesthesia, usually without sedation.
* Careful positioning based on MRI findings.
* A small needle in the lower back to inject saline and contrast.
* Short, real-time X-ray runs to look for leak sites, with extra runs if needed.
* A low-dose CT afterwards in some cases.
* Usual post-lumbar puncture care and brief bed rest.

sameAs: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spontaneous_intracranial_hypotension#Treatment"  :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}
---


## Conservative measures

Long periods of bed rest, extra fluids, caffeine, or abdominal binders have weak evidence. Waiting too long can make diagnosis harder and may delay effective treatment. Early active treatment is often advised.

## Epidural blood patches

An epidural blood patch (EBP) is the first-line treatment. A small amount of your own blood is injected into the space outside the dura in the spine. This can seal the leak and can also reduce CSF loss by gentle pressure.

* Non-targeted EBP: usually in the lower back, often using 20 mL or more of blood.
* Targeted EBP: given at the exact leak site using imaging guidance. Sometimes a fibrin sealant is added. A transforaminal route can reach leaks at the front or side.

What to expect:

* Earlier and larger-volume patches tend to work better.
* More than one patch may be needed.
* Plan to lie flat for about 2 hours after the procedure.

Possible effects and risks:

* Rebound intracranial hypertension can occur within 1 to 2 days. The headache may become worse when lying down and feel different in location. It often responds to acetazolamide.
* Temporary back or shooting leg pain during or after the patch is common and usually settles within weeks.
* Rare risks include epidural or subdural haematoma, infection, venous thrombosis, cauda equina syndrome, or inflammation if blood accidentally enters the CSF.

## Targetted fibrin glue patches

If a specific leak is found, a doctor can inject a medical glue (fibrin sealant) into the epidural space near the leak, sometimes with a small blood patch. This can be done under fluoroscopy or CT, using interlaminar or transforaminal routes to reach front or side defects. It is often used when standard blood patches have not worked. Risks are similar to targeted EBPs.

## Outlook (prognosis)

Many people improve or are cured with EBPs, targeted sealant, or treatment of a CSF-venous fistula. Some need repeat treatments. A small group have persistent or recurring symptoms and benefit from advanced imaging and specialist care. Earlier treatment improves the chance of full recovery and lowers the risk of long-term problems.

about: "CSF venous embolisation involves advancing catheters via venous routes to deliver a liquid embolic into abnormal spinal venous connections draining CSF. It is offered when blood or glue patches fail and a fistula is confirmed."
mainEntity: "https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12087204/"
sameAs: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spontaneous_intracranial_hypotension"
---

## When is it considered?

When a CSF-venous fistula is proven on dynamic myelography, especially if symptoms continue after blood or glue patches, or when the fistula is clearly the main cause.

## What does the procedure involve?

Usually a day-case under conscious sedation or general anaesthesia.

* A vein in the leg, arm, or neck is used for access.
* Catheters are guided into the azygos vein system, then into the small spinal vein that drains the fistula.
* A microcatheter is placed close to the target near the intervertebral foramen.
* The team double-checks the level and side against your imaging.
* A liquid embolic agent is injected to block the abnormal pathway by filling the small veins around the nerve root and nearby epidural veins.
* The access site is compressed by hand to stop bleeding.

## What are the risks?

* Small tears in spinal veins. These are rare and often settle on their own or with more embolic.
* Serious complications are very uncommon. No deaths have been reported in published series, although risk is never zero.
* Rebound intracranial hypertension in about 1 in 10, often managed with a short course of acetazolamide.
* Tiny pulmonary emboli of the liquid agent can occur and are usually symptom-free.
* Bruising at the access site, which usually settles with pressure.
* Local pain at the treatment site, managed with simple pain relief.

## Aftercare and follow-up

* A quick CT may be done straight after to confirm the position of the embolic if needed.
* Most people go home the same day after observation. Take simple pain relief if required.
* You will be told what to look for with rebound intracranial hypertension and whom to contact.

Follow up

* MRI of the brain and spine is usually arranged at about 3 months.
* A simple headache score before and after treatment helps track improvement.

## Subdural haematoma

A subdural haematoma is a collection of blood that builds up between the surface of the brain and the thin covering around it called the dura. It usually happens after a head injury, though sometimes it can develop slowly over time. Because the blood takes up space inside the skull, it puts pressure on the brain. This can be very serious and often needs urgent hospital treatment.

## Symptoms of a subdural haematoma

The symptoms can appear straight away after a head injury, or they may develop gradually over days or weeks. Common symptoms include:

* A severe headache that does not improve with painkillers
* Feeling or being sick
* Confusion, memory problems or changes in behaviour
* Drowsiness or difficulty staying awake
* Slurred speech or swallowing problems
* Blurred or double vision
* Weakness or numbness on one side of the body
* Loss of balance or frequent falls
* Seizures (fits)
* Loss of consciousness, which may last a few seconds or much longer

## When to seek emergency help

A subdural haematoma can be life-threatening. You should call 999 immediately if someone has hit their head and:

* Has not woken up after being knocked out
* Is very drowsy or struggling to stay awake
* Has a seizure (fit)
* Has weakness, numbness or problems speaking, seeing or walking
* Has bleeding or clear fluid coming from their ears or nose
* Has bruising around the eyes or behind the ears without direct injury
* Has had a serious accident such as a car crash or fall from height

Do not try to drive the person to hospital yourself. Wait for emergency services to arrive.

## Diagnosis

If a subdural haematoma is suspected, doctors will carry out a brain scan, usually a CT scan or sometimes an MRI. This shows the size and position of the bleed and helps guide treatment.


## Treatment options

The treatment depends on the size of the bleed and the symptoms.

* **Observation and medicines**: Small haematomas may only need monitoring and medicines to reduce swelling.
* **Surgery**: Most people with a significant subdural haematoma need surgery to remove the blood and relieve pressure on the brain. This can be done in two main ways:

  * **Burr hole drainage**: the surgeon drills small holes in the skull and drains the blood.
  * **Craniotomy**: a section of the skull is temporarily removed so the surgeon can remove the clot before replacing the bone.
* **MMA embolisation**: In some cases, especially with chronic subdural haematomas, a newer treatment called *middle meningeal artery embolisation* may be used. This is a minimally invasive procedure where a doctor uses a thin tube inserted through an artery (often in the leg or wrist) to reach the small artery that supplies the haematoma. Tiny particles or liquids are then injected to block the artery. This helps stop the bleeding and reduces the chance of the haematoma coming back after surgery, or sometimes avoids the need for surgery altogether.


## Recovery from a subdural haematoma

Recovery can take weeks or months. Some people may be left with long-term problems such as difficulty speaking, moving or remembering things. Seizures are also possible. Rehabilitation may involve physiotherapy, occupational therapy and speech and language therapy.

Severe subdural haematomas still carry a high risk of death, even with the best care.

## Living with the effects of a subdural haematoma

The impact of a subdural haematoma can be challenging physically and emotionally. Support is available from healthcare teams, as well as from local or national brain injury groups. Talking with others who have gone through similar experiences can also help.

## Middle Meningeal Artery Embolisation

Middle meningeal artery embolisation (MMAE) is a modern, minimally invasive treatment for **chronic subdural haematoma**. This condition happens when blood slowly collects on the surface of the brain, usually after a head injury, and often affects older people.

Traditionally, treatment has involved surgery to drain the blood. While effective, surgery can be risky and the haematoma sometimes comes back. MMAE is an alternative or additional treatment that addresses the root cause of the problem, making recurrence much less likely.


## Traditional treatment and its challenges

The usual treatment is surgery, often by drilling small holes in the skull to drain the blood (burr-hole surgery). This works well for many patients, but:

* About 1 in 4 patients has a recurrence within a month
* Some patients are not strong enough to undergo surgery
* The operation carries risks, especially in frail or elderly people

## How MMA embolisation works

MMA embolisation targets the **middle meningeal artery**, which supplies blood to the membrane around the haematoma. By blocking this artery, doctors stop the repeated leaks that keep the haematoma alive. Over time, the body can then safely reabsorb the blood.

The procedure is performed by an endovascular specialist. Using X-ray guidance, a thin tube (catheter) is inserted through a small cut in the wrist or groin and carefully threaded through the blood vessels to reach the middle meningeal artery. Once in place, the artery is sealed off using tiny particles, special medical glue, or very small coils.

The whole procedure usually takes less than an hour. Most patients are awake but relaxed with mild sedation, and many can go home the same day.


## Who can have MMA embolisation?

MMAE may be suitable for:

* Patients with a chronic subdural haematoma and only mild to moderate symptoms
* Patients who need surgery but are at high risk of recurrence (for example, those on blood thinners or with brain shrinkage due to ageing)
* Patients who have already had surgery but whose haematoma has come back

## Benefits of MMA embolisation

Compared with traditional surgery, MMA embolisation has several advantages:

* Minimally invasive, with only a small incision in the wrist or groin
* Less discomfort and faster recovery
* Often performed without a hospital stay
* Much lower recurrence rate (around 2–3% compared with up to 25% after surgery)
* Targets the underlying cause of the bleeding, not just the blood that has already collected


## Risks and possible complications

MMA embolisation is generally very safe, but as with any medical procedure there are risks. These include bleeding, infection, stroke, pain, or vision problems. Serious complications are rare and occur in only about 1% of patients.

## Recovery and follow-up

Most people can return to normal activities straight away. The small wound at the access site just needs to be kept clean and dry. Follow-up CT scans are usually done at 6 and 12 weeks to check that the haematoma is resolving.


## Outlook

Chronic subdural haematoma is becoming more common as the population ages, especially in people on blood-thinning medicines. MMA embolisation offers a safe and effective alternative to surgery, with fewer recurrences and quicker recovery.
