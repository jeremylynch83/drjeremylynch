## What is PT?

Pulsatile tinnitus is a rare form of tinnitus where the sound beats in time with your pulse. It is not a disease itself but a symptom that often relates to blood flow or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) movement near the ear.

While non-pulsatile tinnitus usually arises from inner ear or hearing pathway problems, pulsatile tinnitus is more often due to awareness of blood or CSF flow. It can interfere with concentration, sleep and work, and in some people is linked with anxiety or low mood. In certain cases, it may be the first sign of an underlying medical condition.

## Is it serious?

The noise itself is not usually harmful. However, the underlying cause can be important and occasionally urgent, such as a dural arteriovenous fistula or severe narrowing of the carotid artery. Medical assessment is particularly important if the tinnitus is new, worsening, or associated with neurological or visual symptoms.

## What causes it?

Pulsatile tinnitus is most often caused by turbulent or altered blood flow close to the ear, though in some cases it is due to increased awareness of otherwise normal flow. Common venous causes include idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) with transverse sinus stenosis (TSS), where turbulent flow transmits to the cochlea. Sigmoid sinus dehiscence or diverticulum, where a bony defect or outpouching allows venous noise to reach the ear, is another frequent cause. Abnormalities of the jugular vein, such as a high-riding jugular bulb, diverticulum or narrowing, can sometimes present with a bluish mass behind the eardrum and tinnitus. Other venous contributors include marginal sinus stenosis and enlarged emissary veins, which may be treated in selected cases.

Arteriovenous causes include dural arteriovenous fistulae, which are acquired abnormal connections and often produce loud tinnitus that can even be heard by an examiner. Carotid cavernous fistulae, often developing after trauma, may cause both pulsatile tinnitus and eye symptoms. Arteriovenous malformations are a rare cause.

Arterial conditions can also be responsible. Carotid artery narrowing from atherosclerosis becomes more common with age, high blood pressure and high cholesterol. Internal carotid dissection may present with headache, neck pain or neurological signs, with tinnitus occurring in a minority of cases. Fibromuscular dysplasia, which affects medium-sized arteries and often occurs in women, is another recognised cause. Less commonly, aneurysms of the internal carotid or vertebral arteries, as well as congenital variants such as an aberrant carotid course or persistent stapedial artery, can produce symptoms.

Systemic conditions including high blood pressure, anaemia, overactive thyroid, Paget disease, middle ear tumours and head trauma may also contribute.

## Is it inherited?

Pulsatile tinnitus is usually not inherited. Although some people are born with variations in their blood vessels that predispose them to symptoms, most causes develop later in life.

## Who is more at risk?

Women of childbearing age with raised body mass index and idiopathic intracranial hypertension are at particular risk. Older adults with atherosclerosis or other vascular risk factors are also more likely to be affected. People with high blood pressure, anaemia, overactive thyroid or Paget disease, and those with a history of head or neck trauma or venous sinus thrombosis, may be more susceptible.

## What symptoms can it cause?

People with pulsatile tinnitus typically describe a rhythmic whooshing or swooshing sound in one or both ears, or sometimes in the head, that matches the heartbeat. The sound is often more noticeable at night or in quiet environments. Venous causes may change with head position or gentle pressure on the neck. Other symptoms depend on the underlying cause: idiopathic intracranial hypertension can produce headaches, visual symptoms or swelling of the optic nerves; carotid artery disease may cause a neck bruit; tumours or jugular bulb abnormalities can appear as a bluish mass behind the eardrum; and carotid cavernous fistulae may present with eye redness and bulging.

## How is PT diagnosed?

Diagnosis begins with a clinical assessment, including a detailed history and examination to suggest whether the tinnitus is venous or arterial in origin. Listening over the skull and neck with a stethoscope may reveal a sound that is audible to the examiner, termed objective pulsatile tinnitus. Hearing tests and tympanometry can also be useful.

Imaging is chosen according to the suspected cause. Ultrasound of the carotid arteries and neck veins can identify flow disturbances or narrowing. CT of the head and neck provides detailed anatomy, with high-resolution temporal bone CT particularly useful for sigmoid sinus or jugular bulb abnormalities. MRI gives information about the brain, inner ear and surrounding soft tissues. Specialised MRI techniques, such as MRA and MRV, are used to study arteries and veins, including screening for transverse sinus stenosis and dural arteriovenous fistulae.

## Conservative treatments

Initial treatment often focuses on relieving distress and improving coping. Sound therapy can be helpful, using either hearing aids with sound generators or background noise from table-top devices or apps. Education, counselling and psychological therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) or acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) may also reduce distress. Relaxation techniques and good sleep habits can improve quality of life. Managing underlying health factors is important, including controlling blood pressure, treating anaemia or thyroid problems, and supporting weight loss and medication use in idiopathic intracranial hypertension.

## Venous sinus stenting {Pulsatile Tinnitus}

Venous sinus stenting is a minimally invasive procedure that places a stent inside the narrowed sinus to improve blood flow and reduce turbulence. It is used for stenosis related to idiopathic intracranial hypertension, for primary venous sinus narrowing, and in selected cases of sigmoid sinus diverticulum or venous aneurysm.

The procedure is considered when pulsatile tinnitus is persistent and bothersome, and imaging confirms significant venous sinus stenosis, usually after conservative approaches have been tried. It is most often offered in situations such as IIH with transverse sinus stenosis and a measurable pressure gradient, primary venous narrowing without raised intracranial pressure, or residual narrowing after venous sinus thrombosis. Selection is typically based on a pressure difference of at least 6 to 8 mmHg and narrowing of more than 50 percent.

Preparation includes dual antiplatelet therapy and imaging to plan the procedure. Access is usually through the femoral vein under local or general anaesthesia. Pressure measurements are taken across the venous system, and if necessary a balloon is used to open the narrowing before placing a self-expanding stent. Repeat imaging confirms the result. Patients are monitored afterwards for bleeding or access site problems, and antiplatelet therapy is continued for several months.

The most common side effects are mild and temporary, such as headache or a small groin bruise. Less common risks include the need for further treatment in idiopathic intracranial hypertension, in-stent narrowing, or complications from contrast dye or medication.

Outcomes are generally very positive. Many patients experience immediate relief, and large studies report resolution or major improvement in the majority, with overall success rates approaching 90 percent. Systematic reviews confirm high rates of improvement with low complication rates, although a small number of patients may need repeat procedures.

## Aftercare and follow-up

After the procedure, patients usually continue dual antiplatelet therapy for three to six months, followed by long-term aspirin if advised. Management of idiopathic intracranial hypertension, such as weight loss and medication, remains important when relevant. Ongoing monitoring includes tracking the pattern of tinnitus, regular eye checks for papilloedema in IIH, and management of blood pressure and cardiovascular risk factors. Follow-up imaging may be needed if symptoms persist or recur. Urgent medical help should be sought if there is sudden severe headache, new neurological symptoms, sudden visual loss, or ear pain with bleeding.
